I don't regularly watch CNBC, but last week while on vacation, I turned on the Sirius XM radio and was instantly assaulted with Jim Cramer's shrieking.  I was about to turn the channel when he shouted how the "billionaire bears" might finally be catching a break with the stock market downdraft.

I have to give Cramer credit, that's a good line to describe the growing cohort of negative investment legends.  Wondering if Jim came up with it on his own, I googled it.

Aware of the burgeoning $1.99 Kindle romance section where some serious authors have created pseudo names to write under because the money is too good to pass up, I have never actually been exposed to these books.  Until now...

Did Cramer come up with his description after reading Ursala Maya's **[The Billionaire Bears Club](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23787546-billionaire-bears-club)**?  I had planned to quote the summary in this post, but even the summary's innuendo might be pushing it.

Instead I will share with you the first review:

>I am never one to be disparaging, but I was left with no other choice here. I have to say that this was one of the worst books I've ever read. It went beyond gratuitous to a level that I didn't think possible. The writing itself was deplorable alone, but the plot, or lack thereof, was far worse. Ugh, it was just bad bad bad! This is so far from erotic romance. Hell, it had none at all. It also had nothing to do with shifters, and more about an intern being #$%@'d to advance her supposed career. Nothing is sexy about this book, so please do not waste your time on trash like this.

Unfortunately, lately, it's more than terribly written Billionaire Bears Club books that are disappointing.
