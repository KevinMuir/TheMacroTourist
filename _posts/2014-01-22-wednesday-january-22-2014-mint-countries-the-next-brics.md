Most everyone knows the term the BRIC economies. The letters in the acronym stand for Brazil, Russia, India and China.  Although the term is widely used, do you know how it came about?

The acronym was actually coined by Jim O&#8217;Neil, who at the time was the global head research strategist for none other than Goldman Sachs. The term BRICs was born in 2001 when Jim published a paper called &#8220;The World Needs Better Economic BRICs&#8221;. The rest is, as they say, history.

Jim O&#8217;Neil seems like quite a good guy, and over the years I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to him interviewed or reading his research pieces. To me he always seemed a little too nice to be working for the Great Vampire Squid (aka Goldman Sachs).

Last year Jim retired from Goldman, and not content to simply retreat to some Caribbean island and count his money with the rest of the retired Squids, Jim has recently turned up on BBC radio.

And not only has Jim dedicated countless hours teaching the masses about global economics, but he comes armed with a new acronym.

Attempting to replicate his success with the term BRICs, Jim has created a new acronym for the next group of countries that are poised for dramatic economic growth.

This month on BBC Jim unveiled the term MINT &#8211; which stands for Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey. Not only that, Jim actually spent some time visiting each of these countries and created a BBC radio episode on each.

I listened to them all and would highly recommend them. I found them enlightening and enjoyable. Far more informative than listening to Rick Santelli fight with everyone on CNBC.

For those that are interested &#8211; here is the [link.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03nsrhw)

  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03nsrhw"><img class="aligncenter" style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="MINTJimOneilJan2114.jpg" alt="MINTJimOneilJan2114" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/MINTJimOneilJan2114.jpg" width="500" height="363" border="0" /></a>

Four hour long BBC radio programs from a former research analyst hardly constitutes thorough research, but if you are like me and want to understand the issues for long term macro investors, O&#8217;Neil does a great job of discussing the relative merits of each country.

Personally the only &#8220;story&#8221; that intrigued me was Mexico. Although not without its problems, Mexico seems firmly on the right track, while the other countries&#8217; success still seems much more up in the air.

Although I think it is great that Jim has taken to doing some community service hours at the BBC, I do worry about his timing in introducing these countries as the next economic superstars.

We are currently engulfed in a period where Emerging Markets (EM) are dramatically under performing developed markets. I must confess that over the long term, I am much more bullish on the EM than DM, but I am wise enough to recognize that right now the tide is going out for the emerging markets relative to the developed markets. Have a look at the performance of the S&P 500 vs the EEM ETF over the last couple of years:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="SPYEEMJan2214.gif" alt="SPYEEMJan2214" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/SPYEEMJan2214.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">S&P 500 ETF (white line) vs EEM ETF (yellow line)</figcaption></figure> 

The EEM is drifting lower, all the while the S&P 500 is rocketing to new heights. There are a lot of reasons for this outperformance but there can be no doubt that the Emerging Markets&#8217; economies are sagging.

For example, here are the GDP growth rates for two of the bigger countries:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="IndiaGDPJan2214.jpg" alt="IndiaGDPJan2214" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/IndiaGDPJan2214.jpg" width="600" height="286" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">India&#8217;s GDP is consistently growing less&#8230;</figcaption></figure> <figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="ChinaGDPJan2214.jpg" alt="ChinaGDPJan2214" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/ChinaGDPJan2214.jpg" width="600" height="288" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">China&#8217;s GDP is also trending towards less growth&#8230;</figcaption></figure> 

The trend is firmly towards lower growth.

Back to our friend Jim O&#8217;Neil, who when he dons a hard hat, looks more like Bono than an ex-Goldman banker:<figure style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="BonoOneilJan2114.jpg" alt="BonoOneilJan2114" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/BonoOneilJan2114.jpg" width="330" height="350" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Jim &#8220;Bono&#8221; O&#8217;Neil visiting Nigeria</figcaption></figure> 

Jim has highlighted the MINT countries as potential investment opportunities. I am not so sure about his timing.

I created an equally weighted currency basket of the MINT currencies, with a lower value meaning the currencies are losing in value vs the USD:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img class=" " style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="MINTCurJan2114.gif" alt="MINTCurJan2114" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/MINTCurJan2114.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">MINT Currency Basket &#8211; oops&#8230; no bid&#8230;.</figcaption></figure> 

This MINT currency basket is basically in free fall. It is down 14% over the last year with no signs of slowing.

Indonesia and Turkey seem to be especially weak &#8211; suffering from the modest withdrawal of global liquidity as the Fed tapers ever so slightly. Their economies seemed to be perched more precariously than Jim leads you to believe with his MINT pieces.

I believe that the Fed is going to continue with their taper schedule regardless of the effect on the global economy. Given the way that the emerging markets have been trading, I think it is foolish to try to catch these falling knives.

The emerging markets are trading extremely poorly, and I am fearful that if the developed markets suffer at all, the emerging market will not be the beneficiary of a relative move from DM to EM, but instead will find their liquidity drying up even further.

Eventually, Jim&#8217;s MINT countries are going to be a screaming buy. I just don&#8217;t think we are anywhere near that time yet. I will leave it to guys like him with much deeper pockets to start buying today. I will be content to put these names on my screen and wait for the pitch to come in fat over the plate.

**Things that I am watching&#8230;**

**There are no bubbles?**

I often hear statements about how there is no speculative froth in the market. All I can say is have these pundits dialled the chart for the Biotechs?<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="BIOJan2214.gif" alt="BIOJan2214" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/BIOJan2214.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Nasdaq Bio Tech Index &#8211; nothing to see here &#8211; move along&#8230;</figcaption></figure> 

This _**index**_ was trading at a little over 1,000 at the beginning of 2012. It is now over 2600 and seems to be going parabolic. I am sure there is no speculation there and that the increase is completely justified by the fundamentals. And no, this does not have any resemblance to the dot com bubble of the 1990s.

**Positions**

****UPDATE:  Long Yen.****  This is a counter trend trade where I am just begging the Market Gods to punish me.  However, I do believe that the Yen is oversold and due for a move higher.  The Americans shot across the bow might very well be the catalyst. **** **Conviction: 2.  **Stops are last weeks low in Yen terms.

**UPDATE:  Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**UPDATE:  Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Short S&P 500.    **I still believe the risk reward favours the short side.  **We are so close to new highs that you need to steel yourself for the potential breakout, but I am not going to cover into any squeeze and will sit tight into new highs.  I suspect if we do have a break out, it will be a last gasp.  Be ready for a &#8220;pop and drop&#8221;.  **Conviction: 4

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

**Short Canadian dollar.** CAD continues to quietly sink.  Conviction level: 4. Stops to come.  **Short CAD against JPY and EUR.**  Small position size.

**Long various natural gas contracts.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather. Conviction level: 3 No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
