This morning my spidey sense is tingling big time.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/spiderman%20Jun%2011%2013.png" />

I am not sure why.  It could be the 211 pip move in the Yen.  It could be the fact bonds are trading very erratically.   Or it could be the simple fact that there does not seem to be a lot of fear out there even though the Yen moves 2% every night with an even bigger corresponding move in the Nikkei.  The volatility is increasing and I am nervous that investors have not yet reacted appropriately by reducing their positions.

The global financial system is far from balanced, and when it starts to give you clues that all is not well, it is best to head to the sideline and watch from there.

I have virtually no high conviction trades.
