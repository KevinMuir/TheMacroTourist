Yesterday, in response to the plunging value of their currency, the Russian government vowed to intervene &#8220;without quantitative limitations.&#8221; The markets, with visions of Trichet&#8217;s &#8220;whatever it takes&#8221; speech or Abe&#8217;s &#8220;three pillars to combating deflation&#8221; policy quickly put away their pink sell tickets and grabbed some blue buys:<figure id="attachment_12351" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

There is no doubt that strong decisive government actions can sometimes staunch a crisis. We all know that Draghi was able to stop the European credit crisis with his bold words. And we have seen the results of the Japanese Prime Minister&#8217;s commitment to ending deflation. Finally, can anyone forget the famous &#8220;we will sell Francs in unlimited quantities to maintain the peg&#8221; from the Swiss a few years ago?<figure id="attachment_12361" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-12361" alt="EURCHFJan3014.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/EURCHFJan3014.png" width="600" height="383" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/EURCHFJan3014-300x191.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/EURCHFJan3014.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/EURCHFJan3014.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Euro / Swiss Franc Cross Rate &#8211; the Swiss peg it at 1.20 and it works!</figcaption></figure> 

So as much as I applaud the Russian&#8217;s initiative in trying to conjure up the same sort of great moment in Central Bank banking, I think there is one crucial difference that most investors are missing&#8230;

When Draghi said he would do whatever it takes to stem the European credit crisis, his words had authority because technically, he is able to buy as much of one country&#8217;s debt as he wants. All he would need to do is print more Euros to pay for it. I know, I know, from a political point of view it is not that easy, but the point is that there was nothing stopping him.

As for Japan&#8217;s Abe, again, to arrest deflation, he can simply keep printing until it stops. The more he does, the lower the Yen goes and the more inflation is created. The more intervention he does, the more effective the policy.

And finally when it comes to the Swiss, as long as they were willing to accept the consequences of creating all those Francs to maintain the peg, there again was nothing stopping them from doing an unlimited amount.

But the Russians are faced with an entirely different problem. Their problem is that capital is fleeing their country. Their currency is in free fall, not the other way round.

Sure, they can stand in there and intervene for a while. Most countries have foreign exchange reserves that they can sell in exchange for their domestic currency.

However, how are they going to intervene in any unlimited or &#8220;whatever it takes&#8221; fashion? What happens when all the reserves are gone?

It is easy to send your domestic currency down &#8211; any fool can do it. But it is entirely another matter to intervene to strengthen your currency.

In 1992, the Bank of England tried to defend their currency and George Soros famously used their intervention bid to fill his order.<figure id="attachment_12371" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Now I am not saying that Russian&#8217;s bold bluff won&#8217;t work. It very well might be enough to quell the unease in the market and stop the selling.

But I am suggesting that it is a _very different type of intervention_. This is **not the same problem** that the other developed countries are facing. There is no unlimited printing to save the day.  Strong words are probably not going to cut it&#8230;  And eventually even Central Banks run out of margin&#8230;

**Things that I am watching&#8230;**

The US Initial Jobless Claims was released yesterday and they once again disappointed. There were 348k new claims last week versus the 330k expected. Our simple S&P 500 vs Inverted Claims model still hasn&#8217;t narrowed the gap:<figure id="attachment_12451" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

**Positions**

**UPDATE:  Long various natural gas contracts.  I am going to sell all my position today.  It has been a good trade and it is time to watch this one from the sidelines for a bit.**

**Short Canadian dollar.**    Short half a position of CAD vs USD and have a small short CAD vs long JPY.  Conviction 2

**Short S&P 500.    **So far it looks like I didn&#8217;t need to worry about sitting through new highs as late last week the market rolled over pretty hard. Hanging tough and trying to let it cook. Conviction: 4

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

****Long Yen.****  This is a counter trend trade where I am just begging the Market Gods to punish me.  However, I do believe that the Yen is oversold and due for a move higher.  The Americans shot across the bow might very well be the catalyst. **The Yen has started to move my way with the risk off move last week. For now I sit tight.****** **Conviction: 2.  **Stops are last weeks low in Yen terms.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
