Short and sweet today as the MacroTourist is actually on a camping trip with the wife’s in-laws celebrating her father’s 70th birthday. Almost skipped posting, but on Friday I stumbled on a Jim Grant interview that I couldn’t resist writing up.

Jim was asked about the [recent article](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/07/17/lets-be-honest-about-gold-its-a-pet-rock/) by WSJ’s Jason Zweig describing gold as a pet rock.

I have to admit, it’s a pretty good line. It makes a great headline.

Jim was quick to highlight another of the author’s previous stories. This article was written on September 17th, 2011 and it was titled: [“Is Gold cheap? Who knows, but gold miners are…”](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904491704576575051077746110)

In what can only be described as timing that would make a Bruno Mars jealous, Jason Zweig missed top ticking the GDX gold miner ETF by mere days.

He was only three bloody days early! Brilliant! And I am not talking about some interim top that was surpassed in the coming weeks. No, **Jason Zweig wrote that article within days of the ALL TIME HIGH IN GDX.** That price was never to be seen again, and we are now 80% lower.

Man, I have had some bad calls in my day, but this one by Jason Zweig makes them look like slight hiccups. &nbsp;You decide if the pet rock article is bullish or bearish for our poor little yellow friend…

Thanks for reading,
