On Friday I started nibbling on gold. &nbsp;I was obviously at least one day too early as over night in Asia, gold traded down another $100 bucks!

The gold correction has turned into a full fledged crash!

I had an target to initiate my long position of the Gold / S&P 500 spread at 0.925. &nbsp;This morning we have blown right through that and are trading below 0.90.

As much as it feels scary, it is time to follow through with my plan. &nbsp;Into this morning&#8217;s rout, I am backing up the truck and buying gold and selling S&P 500 futures.

Although I think gold could in fact go lower, I believe that gold is signalling that deflation is overwhelming the global financial system. &nbsp;During the past month, we have seen repeated macro indicators warning that the global economy was rolling over. &nbsp;I have outlined how the collapse in confidence of the banking system in Europe is hugely deflationary. &nbsp;Also this morning, China came in with economic numbers that were well below consensus. &nbsp;The world economy is in trouble. &nbsp;Liquidity is shrinking.

I know that seems tough to believe. &nbsp;Isn&#8217;t the Fed and the BoJ printing like money is going out of style? &nbsp;Yes, they are both printing quite aggressively, but the other major Central Bank, the ECB, is way tighter than most believe. &nbsp;

The ECB balance sheet has not grown in a year, and over the last quarter, it has significantly shrunk. &nbsp;

Also, don&#8217;t forget that the Central Bank printing is only one part of the total money supply equation. &nbsp;The expansion of their balance sheets is the high powered reserves which, if the money velocity stays constant, will transfer into an increase in the total money supply for the economy.

However, there is no guaranteeing that the velocity of money will stay constant. &nbsp;Bonehead moves like the Cyprus debacle can scare money into cash, which is highly deflationary and reduce the money velocity.

I believe that gold is going down because liquidity is drying up.

In a highly indebted world, this is a terrible situation and can every easily cause a self reinforcing deflationary spiral.

The last thing that Central Banks should want is for gold to collapse. &nbsp;I know that some may argue that Central Banks don&#8217;t want gold to rise because it means that investors have lost faith in the system. &nbsp;Yes, I guess that is an argument one could make. &nbsp;But I don&#8217;t think this is applicable right now. &nbsp;Is gold going down because the global financial system has become more stable? &nbsp;Not a chance.

Gold is going down because liquidity is drying up. &nbsp;There are other specific factors that are affecting the day to day trading, but if there was enough liquidity in the system, it wouldn&#8217;t be selling off so violently.

It is only a matter of time before this deflation spreads to other assets like stocks.

Therefore, buying gold and selling S&P 500 futures is a great risk reward in here.

Have a look at the long term chart of this ratio:

In the big picture, the gold bull market of the last decade barely registered.

If you believe that the Central Banks are going to successfully navigate us through this monetary experiment then you should indeed buy financial assets and sell gold. 

However, if you feel that this is a disaster waiting to happen, you should step back and look at the big picture and buy gold and sell your stocks.
