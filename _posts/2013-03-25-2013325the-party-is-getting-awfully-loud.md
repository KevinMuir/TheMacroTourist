In the mid 2000s, in the midst of an incredible stock market bull market fuelled by cheap credit brought on by Greenspan and his successor Bernanke&#8217;s ultra loose monetary policy, the private equity group Blackstone led a consortium of other leveraged buyout players in what was the largest private purchase of a technology company ever.  The company that they bought was Freescale Semiconductor and it was also one of the top ten &#8216;taking private&#8217; transactions of all time.  The transaction was financed by massively leveraging the company through the issuing of $6.6 billion of debt.  The fact that the semiconductor industry is extremely volatile did not seem to faze the buyers of the debt.  The massive amounts of liquidity brought on by the credit frenzy of the persistently negative interest rates had brought down credit spreads to absurdly low levels and money was looking for a home.  This was in the height of the covenant light loans and the private equity sharks were willing to lever up anything that moved.

What I remember best about this transaction was a conference call that market strategist Don Coxe gave at the time.  He was careful to not mention any names, but we all knew what he was talking about when he described a chance conversation that he had had with a technology company CEO.  During the conversation the CEO had confided that:

&#8220;I was not surprised that someone was willing to pay me a peak multiple on my company, but usually that happens at the trough in earnings.  I was also not surprised that someone was willing to buy my company at peak earnings. **_ However, I was shocked that someone was willing to pay peak multiple on peak earnings!_**&#8221;

In his mind, the price that the private equity guys were willing to pay for Freescale was absolutely insane.  They were leverging up a volatile company and the only way it was going to be work was if everything went perfectly.

And although things did go perfectly for another few quarters, a year later the market had begun its massive decline as the credit bust hit in full force.

It is with great interest that I note that Freescale stood as the largest private technology company buy out until the recent announcement that DELL would be acquired by the founder Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners.

Now maybe I am wrong, maybe these guys really know what they are doing.  Maybe they are pulling off an Apple &#8211; buying the company when it is down and out, ready for a second coming.

However, my guess is that this has more to do with the availability of cheap credit than anything else.

There is no real actionable trade from this comment except to note that the party is getting awfully loud, and it is time to be eyeing the exit instead of doubling up your Jägermeister shots.
