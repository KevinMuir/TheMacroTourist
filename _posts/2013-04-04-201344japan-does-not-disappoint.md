The first Bank of Japan meeting under new Governor Kuroda concluded last night with a bang. &nbsp;I was worried that they would disappoint the market, but they came through with a massive easing program of 50 trillion Yen ($530 billion USD equivalent). &nbsp;It was more than the market was expecting and their financial markets reacted accordingly. &nbsp;The Yen is down 2.6%, while the Nikkei is up 2.2% and the JGB market has tacked another 40 basis points to the upside.

What are the ramifications of this development? &nbsp;Well for one, it looks like my worry that it wouldn&#8217;t be that easy were overblown. &nbsp;I guess it really is that easy to simply print your way out of any economic problem. &nbsp;

I am shocked that given the moves in the Yen and the other Japanese financial markets that gold continues to trade poorly this morning. &nbsp;This should be massively gold bullish, yet the precious little yella fella can barely get up off the mat. &nbsp;

In real terms the NIkkei is actually down on the day as the currency is down more than the rise in the stock market, but the reaction in the JGBs is surprising to me. &nbsp;I know, I know, they are buying more JGBs, so why shouldn&#8217;t they rise? &nbsp;But based on other QE programs, it should ultimately be bond market bearish. &nbsp;I seem to be alone in this thinking, which doesn&#8217;t bother me, but it is frustrating (and worrisome) that the market seems to be continually disagreeing with me. &nbsp;Today the BoJ pledged to achieve their 2% inflation goal, but all investors did was push JGBs to even lower real rates of return. &nbsp;Obviously JGB investors enjoy earning a negative 150 basis points of real return.

What am I doing from here? &nbsp;

I am going to lift one of the legs of my three pronged short Japanese basket. &nbsp;The short Japanese currency position is massively onside. &nbsp;Although as Dennis Gartman would counsel, you should do more of what is working and less of that is not, this is not my plan of attack. &nbsp;I am sticking with the idea that this is ultimately not that easy and going to give the other two positions a few days to reflect this reality.

Although the initial reaction to the announcement was positive, I continue to believe that this could very well be a &nbsp;&#8216;sell the news&#8217; type opportunity.</p></p>
