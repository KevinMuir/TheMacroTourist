I am running late this morning as my truck wouldn&#8217;t start last night, and I had to meet the tow truck driver this morning to haul it out of my office garage.

Usually I try to not post others&#8217; whole blog posts, but this morning I can&#8217;t resist (and more importantly, I am running short on time). Henry Blodget from Business Insider had a great piece about a meeting he attended while hobnobbing with the 1% in Davos:

> Someone Just Said Something About The Japan-China Conflict That Scared The Crap Out Of Everyone
> 
> HENRY BLODGET
> 
> JAN. 22, 2014, 9:51 AM
> 
> I went to one of those fancy private dinners last night in Davos, Switzerland.
  
> Like most of the events here at the 2014 World Economic Forum, the dinner was conducted under what are known as &#8220;Chatham House Rules,&#8221; which means that I can&#8217;t tell you who was there.
> 
> I can tell you what was said, though. And one thing that was said rattled a lot of people at the table.
> 
> During the dinner, the hosts passed a microphone around the table and asked guests to speak briefly about something that they thought would interest the group.
> 
> One of the guests, an influential Chinese professional, talked about the simmering conflict between China and Japan over a group of tiny islands in the Pacific.
> 
> China and Japan, you may recall, each claim ownership of these islands, which are little more than a handful of uninhabited rocks between Japan and Taiwan. Recently, the Japan-China tension around the islands has increased, and has led many analysts, including Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group, to worry aloud about the potential for a military conflict.
> 
> The Chinese professional at dinner last night did not seem so much worried about a military conflict as convinced that one was inevitable. And not because of any strategic value of the islands themselves (they&#8217;re basically worthless), but because China and Japan increasingly hate each other.
> 
> The Chinese professional mentioned the islands in the context of the recent visit by Japan&#8217;s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. The Yasukuni Shrine is a Shinto shrine where Japanese killed in Japan&#8217;s many military conflicts over the centuries are memorialized — including the Japanese leaders responsible for the attacks and atrocities Japan perpetrated in World War 2. A modern-day Japanese leader visiting the Yasukuni Shrine is highly controversial, because it is viewed by Japan&#8217;s former (and current) enemies as an act of honoring war criminals.
> 
> That&#8217;s certainly the way the Chinese professional at the dinner viewed it.
> 
> He used the words &#8220;honoring war criminals,&#8221; to describe Abe&#8217;s visit to the shrine. And, with contained but obvious anger, he declared this decision &#8220;crazy.&#8221;
> 
> He then explained that the general sense in China is that China and Japan have never really settled their World War 2 conflict. Japan and America settled their conflict, he explained, and as a result, the fighting stopped. But China and Japan have never really put the war behind them.
> 
> The Chinese professional acknowledged that if China asserted control over the disputed islands by attacking Japan, America would have to stand with Japan. And he acknowledged that China did not want to provoke America.
> 
> But then he said that many in China believe that China can accomplish its goals — smacking down Japan, demonstrating its military superiority in the region, and establishing full control over the symbolic islands — with a surgical invasion.
> 
> In other words, by sending troops onto the islands and planting the flag.
> 
> The Chinese professional suggested that this limited strike could be effected without provoking a broader conflict. The strike would have great symbolic value, demonstrating to China, Japan, and the rest of the world who was boss. But it would not be so egregious a move that it would force America and Japan to respond militarily and thus lead to a major war.
> 
> Well, when the Chinese professional finished speaking, there was stunned silence around the table.
> 
> The assembled CEOs, investors, executives, and journalists stared quietly at the Chinese professional. Then one of them, a businessman, reached for the microphone.
> 
> &#8220;Do you realize that this is absolutely crazy?&#8221; the businessman asked.
> 
> &#8220;Do you realize that this is how wars start?&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Do you realize that those islands are worthless pieces of rock&#8230; and you&#8217;re seriously suggesting that they&#8217;re worth provoking a global military conflict over?&#8221;
> 
> The Chinese professional said that, yes, he realized that. But then, with conviction that further startled everyone, he said that the islands&#8217; value was symbolic and that their symbolism was extremely important.
> 
> Challenged again, the Chinese professional distanced himself from his earlier remarks, saying that he might be &#8220;sensationalizing&#8221; the issue and that he, personally, was not in favor of a war with Japan. But he still seemed certain that one was deserved.
> 
> I&#8217;m far from an expert on the Japan-China conflict, and I&#8217;ll leave the analyses of this situation to those who are. All I can tell you is that a respected, smart, and influential Chinese professional suggested at dinner last night that a surgical invasion by China of the disputed islands is justified and would finally settle the Japan-China conflict without triggering a broader war. And that suggestion freaked out everyone in the room.

Now this dark prediction is just the view of some &#8220;Chinese professional&#8221;, so it really doesn&#8217;t mean anything. It is however an interesting theory. I am by no means a geopolitical analytical maven, but when I think about the China&#8217;s position, this gambit actually makes a lot of sense. There can be no denying that China is looking to assert its lead position in Asia, and this might be just the play to do so.

Are the Americans and Japanese really going to go to war over some islands? Yes, they are going to bitch and moan, and it will be scary, but at the end of the day, they would probably just have to sit and take it.

The other worrying developments to come out of Davos was some strange comments that Japanese Prime Minister Abe made. From the NY Times:

> Now, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan has escalated the war of words, telling an audience on Wednesday at the Davos conference in Switzerland that the increasing tensions between China and Japan were similar to the competition between Germany and Britain before World War I, a blunt assessment that concurs with recent remarks by prominent historians.
> 
> Mr. Abe, a star speaker at the gathering, said a “similar situation” existed in both periods because while each set of countries enjoyed strong trade relations, that was not sufficient to overcome the strategic rivalry.
> 
> The prime minister then went on to argue that China’s annual double-digit increase in military expenditures was a major source of instability in the Asia-Pacific region.
> 
> Mr. Abe previously stoked controversy in December when he visited the Yasukuni Shrine, where Japanese war dead are commemorated, including 14 Class A war criminals.
> 
> The Obama administration had warned Mr. Abe not to make the visit. Japan is Washington’s major ally in Asia, but the United States must balance those ties with its relationship with China.
> 
> An increasingly assertive China has also angered its neighbors, most recently with its unilateral declaration of an air defense identification zone over a chain of islands in the East China Sea claimed by China and administered by Japan.
> 
> The deputy secretary of state, William J. Burns, and the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, Daniel Russel, were in Beijing on Wednesday and Thursday for talks on a variety of issues. American officials do not want to become mediators between China and Japan, but they are eager to encourage Japan and South Korea, also an American ally, to improve their sour relations, administration officials have said.
> 
> In Beijing, Mr. Abe’s remarks comparing Germany and Britain in 1914 with China and Japan today met with a blistering response. The chief spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Qin Gang, said that Mr. Abe was “saying these things for the purpose of escaping Japan’s history of aggression.” Mr. Qin said that any possibility of a meeting between Mr. Abe and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, as Mr. Abe has suggested, was out of the question.
> 
> After Mr. Abe made his remarks, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said that the prime minister had not meant that war was possible between China and Japan, and pointed out that in his formal address to the conference Mr. Abe had called for peace and stability in Asia.

I don&#8217;t know if this is all posturing and that it is darkest before the dawn, but I do know that the market is not really ready for any serious escalation of this conflict.

This is just one more negative to put on top of the pile of things the market is choosing to see through rose coloured glasses.

The real question is for how long?

<hr size="2" width="85%" />

**Positions**

**Short Canadian dollar.**   Conviction level: 3. Also **Short CAD against JPY and EUR.**  Small position size.

****Long Yen.****  This is a counter trend trade where I am just begging the Market Gods to punish me.  However, I do believe that the Yen is oversold and due for a move higher.  The Americans shot across the bow might very well be the catalyst. **** **Conviction: 2.  **Stops are last weeks low in Yen terms.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Short S&P 500.    **I still believe the risk reward favours the short side.  **We are so close to new highs that you need to steel yourself for the potential breakout, but I am not going to cover into any squeeze and will sit tight into new highs.  I suspect if we do have a break out, it will be a last gasp.  Be ready for a &#8220;pop and drop&#8221;.  **Conviction: 4

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

**Long various natural gas contracts.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather. Conviction level: 3 No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
