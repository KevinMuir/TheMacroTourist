For the last 5 months investors have become conditioned to buy every dip, with a march to new highs being the Pavlovian response to any sort of temporary weakness.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

This has made investors very complacent.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Yesterday we finally got a big down ugly bar:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="SPXJan1414.gif" alt="SPXJan1414" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/SPXJan1414.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">S&P 500: finally a dip!</figcaption></figure> 

Although we will probably get an emotional spirited rally at some point in the coming few days, the important thing to realize is that yesterday the __character of the market changed.__ Rallies are now to be sold as opposed to dips being bought.

As to whether this is the start of something truly ominous or not, I am not smart enough to know. I believe the market is very overstretched and quite susceptible to a violent bit of profit taking. I also know that there is a dangerous collective belief amongst stock investors that the Fed has &#8220;their back&#8221;. I don&#8217;t think the Fed has anyone&#8217;s &#8220;back&#8221; and that they are in fact eager to continue unwinding their QE3 program.

In fact, many market commentators are blaming yesterday&#8217;s sell off on Fed Governor Lockhart&#8217;s comments:

> *LOCKHART SEES \`GROWING CONFIDENCE&#8217; IN 2014 OUTLOOK
  
> *LOCKHART SAYS U.S. ECONOMY ON \`MORE SOLID&#8217; FOOTING
  
> *LOCKHART BACKS $10 BLN TAPER AS CONFIDENCE IN 2014 GROWS

Lockhart seems to be signalling that Friday&#8217;s unemployment disaster was not enough to derail the Fed&#8217;s plans to taper $10 billion per meeting. The stock market took that as the worst of both worlds &#8211; the economy is weak, but not weak enough to slow down the Fed&#8217;s tapering plans.

Lockhard went on to commit the cardinal sin of commenting on the value of the stock market (even though in the previous breath he had said it was dumb to do so):

> **“One of the stupidest things a central banker could do is comment on the stock market.&#8221;
  
>** ** &#8220;The stock market is not &#8220;a bubble in any way&#8221;**

I am glad that he is so sure that the stock market is not &#8220;a bubble in any way.&#8221;  I am not quite as confident that the market is not merely a reflection of the Fed&#8217;s inflated balance sheet.  But Lockhart probably knows better as we all realize that the Fed very rarely becomes too optimistic about asset prices at the top.  The fact that they have missed the last two big bubbles (dot com and real estate) should not be held against them.

But since stocks are not a bubble,  Lockhart is ready to pull the ripcord on the continued tapering and this was all that was needed to send the market down.

In reality, the market was looking for an excuse to sell off and Lockhart&#8217;s comments just provided the shove. The market is expensive and full of late, weak longs.

Over the week-end, the Goldman Sachs strategy team laid out the frothy state of the equity market:

> S&P 500 valuation is lofty by almost any measure, both for the aggregate market (15.9x) as well as the median stock (16.8x). We believe S&P 500 trades close to fair value and the forward path will depend on profit growth rather than P/E expansion. However, many clients argue that the P/E multiple will continue to rise in 2014 with 17x or 18x often cited, with some investors arguing for 20x. We explore valuation using various approaches. We conclude that further P/E expansion will be difficult to achieve. Of course, it is possible. It is just not probable based on history.
> 
> The current valuation of the S&P 500 is lofty by almost any measure, both for the aggregate market as well as the median stock: (1) The P/E ratio; (2) the current P/E expansion cycle; (3) EV/Sales; (4) EV/EBITDA; (5) Free Cash Flow yield; (6) Price/Book as well as the ROE and P/B relationship; and compared with the levels of (6) inflation; (7) nominal 10-year Treasury yields; and (8) real interest rates. Furthermore, the cyclically-adjusted P/E ratio suggests the S&P 500 is currently 30% overvalued in terms of (9) Operating EPS and (10) about 45% overvalued using As Reported earnings.

Goldman is not alone with their analysis. Almost everything is screaming that stocks are overbought. One of my favourite models that I track is Yardeni&#8217;s &#8220;Fundamental&#8221; stock indicator:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="YardeniJan1414.gif" alt="YardeniJan1414" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/YardeniJan1414.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Yardeni &#8220;fundamental&#8221; indicator (white line) &#8211; S&P 500 (orange line): fair value is almost 200 S&P points lower</figcaption></figure> 

During the last few months, the S&P has shot straight higher without this indicator confirming the advance.  This sort of divergence during the last quarter is typical of most models.  We seemed to catch the wind in our sails during the 4th quarter of 2013 and were lifted up to new levels that were not commensurate with the underlying fundamentals. I believe a big reason for the rally was a portfolio shift from bonds to equities (as many of the investors that were too scared to buy stocks in 2010 or 2011 finally thought the coast was clear) and a move from Emerging Markets (and other commodity countries) into the US (and also Europe).

However, I believe that this move up in the 4th quarter was driven mostly by flows and not an underlying improvement in the economy.

Not only does the stock market assume a robust economic recovery, but the optimism (along with the Fed&#8217;s QE withdrawal) is causing bonds to sink.

Last summer as the market started to prepare for the Fed&#8217;s tapering, rates backed up quite aggressively. This ultimately caused the Fed to delay tapering as the economy did in fact stall from the myriad of financial uncertainties it was facing at the time.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="USG10YrJan1414.gif" alt="USG10YrJan1414" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/USG10YrJan1414.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">US 10 Year Yield</figcaption></figure> 

A week ago, before the horrible unemployment number was released, rates had retraced to approximately the same point as this summer&#8217;s stall.

The question to ask is; whether this back up in rates will once again tighten monetary conditions to the point where the economy stalls?

It is only recently that the market had assumed the economy had reached &#8220;breakout&#8221; levels where the recovery had become self sustaining.  Prior to this point, every hopeful recovery had sagged the moment the Fed took its foot off the accelerator.

Although I don&#8217;t know if we have reached a point where rising rates will not derail the recovery, I do know the market has become _convinced that this is the case._ Therefore, to bet against the market at this point is a low risk bet as a fair amount of optimism has already been priced in.

We have a situation where the market is overbought, very lopsided in terms of bullish sentiment, the economy is weak, yet not weak enough to stop the Fed from tapering and rates are at levels that caused problems in the past.  Up to this point, the only thing missing was for the fever to break.

Yesterday I think it finally did, and I will be shorting any sort of strength that develops later today or tomorrow.

**Things that I am watching
  
Japan&#8217;s trade deficit**

Last night Japan released their trade figures. Much to everyone&#8217;s surprise, the trade deficit continues to deteriorate:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="JapanTradeBalanceJan1414.gif" alt="JapanTradeBalanceJan1414" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/JapanTradeBalanceJan1414.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Japan&#8217;s Trade Balance &#8211; deficit hitting new highs</figcaption></figure> 

This is quite amazing given how weak the Yen has been:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="JPYJan1414.gif" alt="JPYJan1414" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/JPYJan1414.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Japanese Yen versus the US dollar (higher rate means Yen weakness)</figcaption></figure> 

The famed Abeconomics is doing wonders for the stock market, but the actual economy does not seem to be enjoying the same sort of spoils:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="NKYJan1414.gif" alt="NKYJan1414" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/NKYJan1414.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Japanese Nikkei Stock Index</figcaption></figure> 

Central Bankers throughout the world are watching Japan closely as, on a relative basis, their QE policies are the largest any developed economy has ever experienced. How their economy weathers through this is going to be very important for setting policies in the decades to come. Although many market participants are extremely optimistic about the efficacy of Japan&#8217;s monetary stimulus, I am not as confident that it will be as smooth sailing as they believe.

My suspicion is that we are going to see some increasingly interesting market movements in Japan in the coming quarters. This trade deficit trend is not a welcome development and is a sign that all is not rosy.

**Positions**

**UPDATE: Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

**UPDATE: Short S&P 500 into strength.  **I will be shorting any rallies in the S&P over the next couple of days.  I am going to be somewhat patient as I don&#8217;t think we are headed straight down and I might get a better level to establish my position.  But I do believe the trend has changed.  Conviction: 4

**Short Canadian dollar.** CAD continues to quietly sink.  Conviction level: 4. Stops to come.  **Short CAD against JPY and EUR.**  Small position size.

**Long various natural gas contracts.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather. Conviction level: 3 No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** I am long bond market volatility as I think the next crisis will start in the bond market. Conviction level: 3.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 6
