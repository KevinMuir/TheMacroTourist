A few months back I recommended buying some [Bellatrix Exploration on the over reaction to the Joint Venture news.](http://www.gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2013/6/3/bellatrix-exploration-market-is-over-reacting-fading-the-weakness)

Proving that a stopped clock is still right twice a day, I managed to get this one right.

BXE has basically rallied ever since and is now over 40% higher.

Although the outlook for the company is still bright, I think it is time to head to the sidelines. Â I am selling my whole position.
