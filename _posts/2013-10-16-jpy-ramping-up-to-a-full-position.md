A couple of weeks ago I initiated a short JPY (long USDJPY) position. I have been fortunate in that the position has been steadily going in my favour since then.

Today I am going to ramp it up to a full position.

There is a monster technical pattern on the Yen chart that many market participants are watching closely. It is a large wedge that has still not resolved itself:

I have felt that the big move from earlier in the year was due for some consolidation before it could resume. It was truly a massive move, and there was no way that the rate of decline in the Yen would be tolerated within the G20. These last few months is exactly what the doctor ordered in terms of the Japanese stealth devaluation slipping off everyone&#8217;s radar.

Although the Yen has not yet broken out of the wedge, I am going to assume that the best bet is for the breakout to be in the direction of the long term trend.

I am now fully short Yen (long USDJPY for the chart purposes).
