I have a rule that I don&#8217;t take company meetings.  Specific company analysis is not really my forte and I am worried that since I don&#8217;t have a stream of different management groups parading through my office every day, I will not develop the skill set to differentiate a good presenter with a good company.  I don&#8217;t trust myself not to fall in love with a story, so I refuse to meet with management.

So as I write this post, please keep this failing at the forefront of your mind as I have definitely &#8216;fallen&#8217; for this story (even though I have never met with management).  It is a stock that I have had a long (and not that profitable) relationship with, yet I continue to be enamoured with it.  Like a first crush, it seems to always have a soft spot in my heart.

The company is Ithaca Energy and it is North Sea oil explorer / producer.  Over the years, they have consistently added to reserves through exploration and tuck-in acquisitions.  Although at one point the North Sea was the home of elephant size oil fields, it is now a smaller, less exciting area for oil development.  However Ithaca Energy has managed to studiously create a great little energy company that specializes in this area.  Although they consistently seem to be able to grow the company, the market refuses to assign an appropriate multiple to their cash flow.  The stock is perpetually cheap.  I know, I know, anytime you hear someone telling you how the market doesn&#8217;t understand their stock you should run the other way.  And indeed, maybe you should.  But here is why I think Ithaca deserves a look.

In late 2011 Ithaca was approached by a third party that was interested in potentially buying Ithaca.  Although this has never been released, rumour has it that it was a middle Eastern national oil conglomerate.  When Ithaca received the interest, management decided that the best course of action was to open up the books and conduct an auction for the company.  The company hired an investment banker, interested companies signed non-disclosure and lock up agreements and the process began.

A lot of the following information is post game water cooler gossip, but as far as I can tell, at first the process was going fine.  The original middle Eastern company did not want the publicly, so they dropped out of the bidding, but two other companies were actively interested in Ithaca.  However, as this process continued, the European crisis started gathering steam.  At first it wasn&#8217;t a big deal, but then financial spreads started blowing out.  It also didn&#8217;t help that Brent Oil (the type that Ithaca produces) quickly went down $25.  The auction process concluded at a terrible time when the European crisis was in full bloom.

To the surprise of everyone (including especially me), at the auction deadline, Ithaca announced there were no bids.  Ooops.  Not the words risk arbitrageurs like to hear.  No bids&#8230;

Up until that point Ithaca had traded above $3 on the idea that it would be taken over in the $3.50-$4 range.  You will notice that someone &#8216;knew&#8217; something going into the week before the announcement as it traded down to $2.50, but then quickly rallied back to approximately $3 on the announcement date.

When the &#8216;no bid&#8217; announcement came, investors piled out of the stock and it traded all the way down to $1.50 on the liquidation.

I was surprised by the whole debacle because, although I was concerned that the market was being overly enthusiastic when it was trading at $3.25, I thought that there would be a strategic buyer bid at $2.50.  It was my view that a strategic buyer woud see past the Eurocrisis that was dominating the headlines and bid for the company.  Therefore I was shocked when there was &#8216;no bid&#8217; and it was one of my worst losses of 2012.

After getting tagged, I decided that my initial instincts about not falling in love with stories was correct and that this was the price of re-learning that lesson.

I didn&#8217;t trade Ithaca for a long time.  During that period, management just resumed to steadily growing the company.  For the next year, the stock drifted between $1.75 and $2.25.

Then a couple of months ago, Ithaca announced that they were going to buy Valiant Petroleum, which is another smaller North Sea oil company listed in London.  Valiant is a similar type of company, with very complimentary assets.  They had also suffered from poor valuation, and were trading very cheap versus their cash flow.  Ithaca jumped at the chance to increase their size by purchasing quality assets at a discounted price.

However, the market was most likely hoping that Ithaca would be taken over, not doing the purchasing, and very swiftly punished Ithaca.

This decline has been too much for me to watch, and I have re-established my much too big position in the name.

Ithaca did not over pay for Valiant, they actually purchased quality assets at a great price.  In doing so, they ultimately made themselves more &#8216;saleable&#8217; to a large oil company.

It was only a year ago that big energy companies were indicating that they were going to pay upward of $3 for IAE.  Since then, Ithaca&#8217;s fundamentals have only gotten better.  Although I am not confident that Europe will not rise to the fore again with some sort of crisis, buying IAE at $1.86 after it has been beat up due to a smart acquisition poses much less risk than previously when there was a ton of hype priced into the stock.

And it is not just me that thinks so.  During the last week, as the stock has declined, there has been a raft of insider buying.  This buying is not &#8216;exercising of options type buying&#8217;, but rather &#8216;write a cheque and buying on the board&#8217; buying:

  * Ithaca Energy Inc. (TSX: IAE, LSE AIM: IAE) announces that on April 3, 2013 three Officers of the Company increased their beneficial shareholdings in Ithaca, purchasing a total of 65,000 Common Shares.  Iain McKendrick (Chief Executive Officer) acquired 30,000 Common Shares at GBP1.14 per share, increasing his beneficial holding to 205,465 Common Shares, representing approximately 0.08% of the issued share capital of the Company.
  * Graham Forbes (Chief Financial Officer) acquired 15,000 Common Shares at GBP1.14 per share, increasing his beneficial holding to 64,645 Common Shares, representing approximately 0.03% of the issued share capital of the Company.
  * John Woods (Chief Developments Officer) acquired 20,000 Common Shares at GBP1.12 per share, increasing his beneficial holding to 131,445 Common Shares, representing approximately 0.05% of the issued share capital of the Company.Ithaca Energy Inc.

  * John Summers, Chairman, bought 40,000 shares in the company on the 5th April 2013 at a price of 112.00p. The Director now holds 254,700 shares.

The insiders obviously think that this is a great time to pick up some shares.

The stock is cheap and it is getting punished undeservedly.  Time to stand in here and take the other side.

How cheap is it?  Tough to say as there are not a lot of comparables, but Vic Vallance from Fraser Mackenzie did this great comparable against Enquest PLC:

Ithaca is my new favourite single stock long and I am going to forgive it for all the previous transgressions that it has cost my P&L.  Hopefully this is not an abusive relationship where I just keep coming back to a bad household that causes me only pain.
