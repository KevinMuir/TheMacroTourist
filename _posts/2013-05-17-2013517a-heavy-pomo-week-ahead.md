Yesterday I took a stab at the short side of the market, with the caveat that I was going to be quite impatient with it and by no means was I going to be short today.  Well, it didn&#8217;t work, and I just want to reiterate &#8211; be extremely careful with your shorts.

I know it is tempting.  I know the market seems to be up here on air.  I know it seems that it is simply &#8216;due&#8217; for a pull back.

But don&#8217;t forget the chart that Rosenberg brought to our attention:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/Feb%20Total%20BS%20to%20SPX%20May%2017%2013.gif" />

The ratio of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Total Balance sheet versus the price of the S&P 500 has been remarkably stable since 2008.  In the absence of other information, the correct bet is to assume that this stability will continue.

And given that assumption, since the Federal Reserve is due to make the following purchases over the next few days:

  * Friday May 17th &#8211; $5 billion coupons
  * Monday May 20th &#8211; $1.5 billion coupons
  * Tuesday May 21st &#8211; $3 billion coupons
  * Wednesday May 22nd &#8211; $1.5 billion coupons
  * Thursday May 23rd &#8211; $3.50 billion coupons

it makes absolutely no sense to stand in the way and shorting S&Ps in the shadow of Ben Bernanke&#8217;s massive purchases.  I watch the POMO (Permanent Open Market Operations) schedule pretty closely and this is one of the more stacked periods that I have ever seen.  It is a real barrage of buying concentrated over the next week.

I am going to err on the side of not writing any pink sell tickets until late next week.

As the late great Marty Zweig said, &#8216;don&#8217;t fight the Fed&#8217;.
