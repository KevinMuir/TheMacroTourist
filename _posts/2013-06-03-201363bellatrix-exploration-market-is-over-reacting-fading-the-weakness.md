This morning Bellatrix Exploration announced that their Joint Venture would not be proceeding because their Korean partner was unable to meet the remaining closing conditions.

The market has been spooked by this news and has sent the stock down to new lows:

BXE has been trading weakly over the last few trading days and now we know why.  Remember the price often moves ahead of the news.

I have long been enamoured with this company and have held the convertible bonds as a core long term holding for quite some time.

With this big sell off in the stock, I am also adding a new stock position to my sheets.

I believe there is a good chance that BXE is acquired, and this just makes it all the &#8216;cleaner&#8217;.  My assumption is that this failure to proceed with the JV has very little to do with BXE, and that the weakness represent a buying opportunity.

I might be wrong and it might be that this was the clue that I should have bailed from the name, but I think it is a quality company that is unduly getting beat up.  I am adding to my long convertible position with long stock as well.  (or as we like to call it in the industry &#8211; putting on the &#8216;ole Texas hedge)
