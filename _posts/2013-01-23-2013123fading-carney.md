The Bank of Canada met today.  Governor Carney surprised the market by tilting the Bank slightly to the dovish side.  The main theme of this morning&#8217;s announcement was that the anticipated need to raise rates in the future is now less imminent.

The Canadian dollar sold off hard on the news:

The BAX futures curve (3 month Canadian Bankers Acceptances) immediately repriced the rate of future increases.

BAX futures are priced in yield terms, with the contract settling at a price of 100 minus the yield for 3 month Bankers Acceptance on the delivery date.  Therefore a lowering of rates causes these futures to rally.  On this chart the brown line represents the various BAX contracts at yesterday&#8217;s close, while the green line is the current price after the BoC announcement.

You can see that the entire curve rallied across the board reflecting a decrease in the likelihood of the Bank of Canada raising rates.

Here is the price for the specific BAX future expiring in December of 2013.

The recent sell off has been thwarted and the contract has rallied back into the range established over the last 6 months.

I am going to start &#8216;fading&#8217; Carney by shorting these futures in the 98.65 to 98.70 level over the next few days.

I will also short the BAX future for March 2014:

This chart is very similar to the BAX Dec 13 contract and is only trading 5 basis points higher, reflecting a low chance of the Bank raising rates between these two dates.

### Why am I fading the Bank of Canada&#8217;s recent move?

Although I am sympathetic to the Bank&#8217;s assessment that economic growth is stalling, at the end of the day I believe that any weakness in the Canadian economy will be more than offset by a decent North American recovery.  I believe that Canada will indeed suffer because of a global growth slowdown, with China in particular under performing expectations, which will lead to relative weakness in commodity centric countries like Canada.  But that weakness will be masked by the fact that the United States, which is by far Canada&#8217;s largest trading partner, is going to surprise to the upside.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/51003ca3e4b037c85e6f8a26/1358970021685/carney88_ret.jpg" />

I believe Carney & Co. are overly pessimistic about Canada&#8217;s short term prospects.  With Bernanke&#8217;s foot firmly on the accelerator, the proper bet is to assume that monetary policy will eventually have its effect, which will translate into a stronger Canadian economy.

Do not get me wrong, I am firmly pessimistic about the medium term prospects of the Canadian economy.  The over reliance on commodity exports combined with the local real estate bubble which has made the economy appear stronger than it is, are going to be massive headwinds over the next 5 years.

But these are long term issues.  Short term we are entering into a cyclical uptick that will keep the Canadian economy on firm footing.  To a large extent, the concerns that the Bank of Canada mentioned were mainly yesterday&#8217;s worries:

> In Canada, the slowdown in the second half of 2012 was more pronounced than the Bank had anticipated, owing to weaker business investment and exports

This is not forward looking analysis.  The Bank was previously overly bullish on growth prospects and is now merely adjusting their forecasts to reflect the fact that they were wrong.

However, the part that really concerns me is the Bank&#8217;s sanguine attitude about inflation:

> Core inflation has softened by more than the Bank had expected, with more muted price pressures across a wide range of goods and services, consistent with the unexpected increase in excess capacity.

> Total CPI inflation has also been lower than anticipated, reflecting developments in core inflation and weaker-than-projected gasoline prices.

> Total CPI inflation is expected to remain around 1 per cent in the near term. It is expected to rise gradually, along with core inflation, to the 2 per cent target in the second half of 2014 as the economy returns to full capacity and inflation expectations remain well-anchored.

I am not nearly as confident that inflation expectations are as &#8216;well-anchored&#8217; as the Bank believes.

Given that current 3 months BAs are trading 1.29%, that equates to a BAX futures spot price of 98.71.  When you short the Dec 13 contract at 98.66, the curve is only 5 basis points steeper.  This is basically pricing very little chance that the Bank is going to raise rates before the end of the year.

Although it is far from a sure thing, I believe the chances for an increase are greater than the market is currently pricing.

&#8216;Fading&#8217; Carney into this rally seems to be a good risk reward.  The market is assuming a level of clairvoyance that he simply doesn&#8217;t possess.
