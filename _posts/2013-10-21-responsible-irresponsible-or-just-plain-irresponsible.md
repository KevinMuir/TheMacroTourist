Over 5 years ago, when PIMCO&#8217;s Paul McCulley hadn&#8217;t yet gone all &#8220;Planet of the Apes&#8221; on us, he argued that the Fed needed to be &#8220;responsibly irresponsible&#8221; to break out of the deflationary trap.

Paul McCulley then:

Paul McCulley now:

It was actually a Paul Krugman theory, but McCulley also believed that once the larger credit super cycle rolled over and started contracting, the only way a Central Bank could break the self reinforcing contractionary vicious circle was for economic participants to become convinced that the Central Bank was going to allow inflation to break out above the previously targeted rates. Without this belief, private market participants would simply refuse to expand their borrowing. With a heavily indebted balance sheet, the marginal desire to accumulate another unit of debt is very low. Therefore companies and individuals need to be very convinced that expanding borrowing makes economic sense. The only way they can be &#8220;convinced&#8221; to expand their borrowing is for them to believe that they can borrow today and pay back in the future with depreciated dollars. 

The Central Bank therefore needs to become &#8220;responsibly irresponsible&#8221; in allowing inflation. Without this, there would be no incentive for companies and individuals to expand their borrowing, and the liquidity trap would continue its self reinforcing spiral lower.

I am not saying I agree with this as a long term solution (I am concerned that it simply layers more debt onto an already indebted economy), but I believe for the first years after the credit crash of &#8217;07, this lack of &#8220;irresponsibility&#8221; has been one of the reasons that the money velocity has continued to plummet.

Both times QE1 and QE2 was ended, the economy quickly rolled over. The market understood that the Fed was not going to allow inflation to run out of control, so there was very little incentive to borrow. 

During this period, the velocity of money simply continued its scary decent:

The Fed aggressively pushed money into the system, but the private sector refused to believe that there was anything to do with the money. Therefore it simply piled up in the banking system. Here is the chart of the excess reserves over the last few decades:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/EXCSRESNS_Max_630_378.png" alt="EXCSRESNS Max 630 378" title="EXCSRESNS_Max_630_378.png" border="0" width="600" height="360" />

The Central Bank had not being able to convince very many private sector participants to take out a loan. 

However, over the last few months, this has changed dramatically. 

I am not sure what the trigger has been &#8211; but the animal spirits have been revived. Could it be that the worry about Yellen as an Uber-Dove was enough to convince the market that it was time to take out some credit? Or did it happen much earlier when the bond market finally rolled over this spring, thus worrying participants that the lows were in for yields? Or did the Fed simply convince everyone that they were truly insane with their monetary priming and that it would never end?

Whatever the cause, I believe that the velocity of money has been accelerating. 

The real question that needs answering is whether the latest Washington circus will scare the private sector back into their de-levering shell? I am not sure. There is definitely a school of thought that the confidence killer will cause an economic hiccup. 

But here is another idea. Maybe the market will realize how little the government actually knows what they are doing, and that it is for sure going to end badly with inflation, thus borrowing money today to pay it back with depreciated dollars later might make some sense.

Maybe between the worries about Yellen and the realization about the fools that are in charge in Washington, the market has finally concluded that the authorities truly are &#8220;irresponsible&#8221;, just probably not responsibly so.

Either way, if the animal sprits have indeed been awakened (for whatever reason), don&#8217;t forget that chart of the Excess Reserves. There is a monster amount of fuel sitting there waiting to be loaned out. 

I am watching closely, but I am very cognizant to the fact that there is a good chance that we might have hit the tipping point regarding credit creation. If so, I need to trade much differently as this would indicate that we have hit a period where the Fed becomes dramatically behind the curve in terms of liquidity creation in the economy.
