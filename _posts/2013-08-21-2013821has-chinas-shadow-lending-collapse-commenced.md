Although ZeroHedge has picked up the story about China&#8217;s largest insurance general manager being arrested, the rest of the trading public seem to be more fixated about the potential Fed taper. &nbsp;At this point, I for one don&#8217;t care one iota if the Fed tapers as any tapering is going to &nbsp;

  * be less than the market expects
  * <span style="line-height: 1.6em">still leave the Fed buying $50+ billion of securities a month</span>

However, I am extremely interested in the potential acceleration of the unwind of the greatest credit bubble of all time &#8211; namely China. &nbsp;So when the General Manager of Fanxin, China&#8217;s largest insurance broker, is caught leaving the country with 500 million Yuan stuffed in his suitcase, I take notice. &nbsp;According to ZeroHedge:

> <span>The general manager of Fanxin, China&#8217;s largest insurance dealer, has been arrested (after </span>**fleeing the coutry with CNY 500 million**<span>) and the entire industry is now under close scrutiny after regulators found that the company was selling unauthorized fixed-income financial agreements. Fanxin offered huge commissions to its staff to sell &#8216;wealth management products&#8217; that were merely used to buy more insurance products in what appears a ponzi-like scheme. </span>**Investors were &#8216;encouraged&#8217; to purchase these with promises of yields up to 20%.** <span>As Caixin reports, &#8220;such a high yield promise is definitely unsustainable,&#8221; as </span>_Fanxin customers &#8220;thought they were buying the normal wealth management products like the ones offered by banks,&#8221; but actually these products were made by Fanxin and funds were put into higher risk insurance products._ <span>In an unsurprising echo from the &#8216;liar loans&#8217; of the US, the documentation was often forged or had fake contact information that could have been easily detected, but </span>**insurance companies ignored the problems for the sake of premium revenues**<span>.</span></p> </p> 

ZH hints about an &#8216;echo of the liar loans of the US&#8217;. &nbsp;The important part to remember about those loans was that **at the time&nbsp;****almost no one understood the pervasiveness of the fraud. &nbsp;**It is easy to now look back with the benefit of hindsight and say it was obvious, but it wasn&#8217;t. &nbsp;The human mind often selectively rejigs history to make sense of the past. &nbsp;As a trader or investor, it is important to remember how difficult it was to fully understand the depth of the problem until well after the fact.

In terms of China, I think there is a good chance that many of today&#8217;s investors will make the same mistake. &nbsp;It is very easy to assume that the problem isn&#8217;t that bad. &nbsp;It is easy to say that China will be able to stickhandle through the problems. &nbsp;

It takes a real leap of faith to admit that much of the China growth miracle sits upon a great credit bubble. &nbsp;&nbsp;

I am not sure if I am fully ready to take that leap, but when I see articles like the one above, I keep my mind open to the fact that the potential for a disorderly unwind in China is real. &nbsp;We have read about all the &#8216;shadow lending&#8217; that has occurred in China over the last few years and no one really knows the size of the problem. &nbsp;If my hunch that it is larger than the market realizes is correct, then signs that the unwind is upon us is very important.

So I will leave everyone else to fret over whether the Fed is going to taper. &nbsp;I am much more interested if China&#8217;s shadow lending collapse has begun.&nbsp;
