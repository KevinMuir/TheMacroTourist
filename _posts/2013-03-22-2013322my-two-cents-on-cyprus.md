I have been on vacation for the last week with the family in the Caribbean, so I am late writing about the developments in Cyprus.

Last Sunday when the news first hit, the initial reaction was quite negative.  The financial press was filled with worries about the coming Cyprus led Eurocrash.

However, as Monday arrived the BTFD crowd _(BTFD = Buy the ^$%@ Dip)_ found ways to rationalize the draconian actions of the EU, the market quickly filled the gap and closed just slightly down on the day.

Since then, there has been much debate about the seriousness of the Cyprus credit crisis.  The market has basically meandered higher as consensus has emerged that Cyprus is a one off affair that has more to do with Russian oligarchs hiding assets in a tax haven than a real European nation failing.

**From an economic perspective, in the grand scheme of things, this crisis does not matter in the slightest.  However, the political ramifications of the EU&#8217;s handling of this credit crisis has enormous ramifications that markets are completely underestimating.**

The solution that the Eurocrats are forcing on the people of Cyprus is one of the most egregious abuses of power that I have ever seen.  Their banks made extremely bad business decisions &#8211; there can be no denying that.  Their country is basically bankrupt and the standard of living of the average citizen of Cyprus is going to have to come down.  The only question is how you assign the costs and how do you clean up the mess.

The decision to leave the bank bond holders intact, yet to impose a haircut on depositors is absolute madness.  The bond holders invested in a risky bank and should have full well understood the risks.  **The depositors on the other hand had government guarantees on their deposits which are now being completely ignored.  **This is absolutely stunning!  The EU is in essence stealing from depositors!

What is going to be the reaction of the average man on the street who goes about his business and tries to save a little money for retirement?  They will never ever trust banks again!  Period.  Full stop.  And don&#8217;t think the average guy in Spain or Italy doesn&#8217;t see the handwriting on the wall.

**_The EU has taken the confiscation of private property genie out of the bottle, and there is no putting him back._**  Even if they backtracked on the whole deal, the thought that governments can arbitrarily confiscate wealth from bank depositors (while leaving bank bond holders intact) is forever burned into the minds of millions of Europeans.

Considering that most peripheral European countries are desperately in need of capital, this about the worst thing that you could do.

I know the Eurocrats will try to rationalize that it is simply taking money from dishonest Russians who were using Cyprus as a tax haven, but the EU&#8217;s plan did not differentiate between locals and foreigners.  And even if it did, any confiscation of wealth is a terrible precedent to set &#8211; whether it is the Russian mafia or not.

Currently, the market has found a way to justify many of these EU policies.  It has looked through the issue and said that it is not a big deal.

**_Well, markets often miss the big picture and this is one of those times.  _**

The EU has taken the first step on a dangerous road.

Let&#8217;s face facts.  Western society is hugely indebted.  Governments have made promises to the people that in the long run will have no way of being able to be honoured.  There is going to be some forced restructuring of wealth.

However, to punish the very people who were the most conservative &#8211; the savers, is absolutely asinine.  This is a remarkably stupid policy.  This has pretty well guaranteed that as things get ugly, people will rush for the exit.

I am far from one of these hard money guys who has a stash of gold coins buried in my backyard.  However for the first time, it became extremely clear to me what the ugly side of the end game could look like.  Wait until there are more Cyprus&#8217;s springing up all over the world as the bad debts finally come due.  There is going to be a scramble to take, without any thoughts about who you should take from. **_ Instead of taking from those that are most deserving, they will simply take from those that is easiest.  _**

The Cyprus precedent is extremely worrisome.  For those that are dismissing it as too small to matter or a one off event, they would be well to remember that history is filled with many other warnings that were not heeded until too late.

As for tradeable ideas&#8230;  I think you continue to short European stocks, European PIIGS credit and buy gold.  Cyprus is a symptom of the fact that Europe is in really terrible shape and only making things worse with continual policy blunders.
