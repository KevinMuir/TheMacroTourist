Last month [I sold my U CN Equity position](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2013/7/24/when-the-ducks-quack-feed-em-selling-some-of-my-u-position).  My main reason was that I felt some of the hedge funds were reaching for this closed end fund that invests in Uranium, and I felt I might be able to pick it up cheaper in the future.

I was fortunate enough to time this one correctly and since my July 24th piece, the fund has drifted lower:

The price of Uranium has drifted lower, but the U CN Equity premium to NAV has also narrowed:

Although it is not trading at the big discount to NAV that we experienced last year, you are no longer paying a premium and can buy the closed end fund at basically the NAV.

However, since I last wrote the piece recommending you sell the U CN Equity because it was trading at a premium to NAV, I read an interesting research piece out of Casey Research that highlighted the difference between spot Uranium and forward Uranium prices.   They contend that there is very little uranium that trades in the spot market and that the real market is the forward market.

I did a little research and found this great chart from the Cameco website that graphs both the spot and the long term forward price:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/520a9a27e4b08d9753ca3b97/1376426536886/Cameco%20-%20Investors%20-%20Markets%20-%20Uranium%20Price.jpg" />

You will notice that although the blue spot price is trading at $35 a pound, the forward contract is trading more than 50% higher at $54 per pound.

If you accept the theory that the forward price is the real price, then my whole calculation of the premium to discount to NAV of U CN Equity is flawed.  Instead of trading right in line with NAV, it would actually be trading at a 35% discount to NAV.   This is probably why some of the larger hedge funds were comfortable buying it at a premium.

I like to own things that decay upward, and in my mind, the way that uranium is trading has introduced a positive carry to this trade.

The long term price very well might drift lower and converge with spot, but it more likely that the spot is being driven by short run trade flows that have temporarily depressed the price.

I am starting to re-establish my long position in U CN Equity.
