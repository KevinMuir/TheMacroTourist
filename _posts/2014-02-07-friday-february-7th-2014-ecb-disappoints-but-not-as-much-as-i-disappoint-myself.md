> &#8220;Pardon my French, but Cameron is so tight that if you stuck a lump of coal up his ass, in two weeks you&#8217;d have a diamond&#8221; &#8211; Ferris Bueller

Although Ferris was talking about his best friend Cameron, I think Ferris would have also used his French skills to describe Mario Draghi and the ECB governors yesterday who threw cold water on any idea that they would ease monetary policy in the face of the persistent deflation the EU is experiencing.  The ECB left all policies unchanged and indicated that they were not about to end their sterilizations (which would have been a sort of back door QE).

Even though Darghi did mouth some conciliatory words during the press conference, by then it was too late &#8211; the markets were expecting more.

The EUR exploded higher:<figure id="attachment_13581" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I know there are some who argue that the European economy continues to improve and that nothing needs to be done, but I believe that the relative tightness of the ECB versus the other major Central Banks is sowing the seeds for a moribund economy in the quarters to come.

Have a look at this great chart from ZeroHedge:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter" style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="EULoanFeb0714.jpg" alt="EULoanFeb0714" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/EULoanFeb0714.jpg" width="600" height="357" border="0" />
</p>

The private loan growth continues to plummet. When you combine this with an ECB that is shrinking their balance sheet, you have the perfect recipe for deflation.

This is not the stuff of heady economic growth.

Draghi and the ECB continues to make the mistake that Japan made between 2008 and 2012. They are failing to understand that the other countries&#8217; massively expansionary monetary policies are going to steal growth from the EU and that they will end up importing the world&#8217;s deflation.

As for my trading, I put on a Euro short a week ago with about as much patience and panache as a 16 year boy in the back seat of his parents&#8217; car fumbling for the first time with his girlfriend&#8217;s bra strap. I was too eager to anticipate that the ECB would be forced to recognize how much their relatively tight monetary policy is affecting their economy and that they would embark on a new round of interest rate cuts.

Not only that, but the real problem lay in the fact that the rest of the hedge fund community also seemed to be enamoured by the same logic and they had set themselves up heavily short the Euro.  So when the ECB meeting did not result in instant gratification, the exit was rushed and the EUR rallied hard as shorts were covered.

_I hate being in trades that are popular with hedge funds, and this is simply one more example._ When I see a trade that many hedgies are climbing aboard, I should take a deep breath and wait.

It is made all the worse by the fact that I had recently read a great study that shows how the EUR tends to rally after ECB meetings. Although I aware of this tendency, I dismissed the evidence and thought this time &#8220;I knew&#8221; better. Dumb. Really dumb.

Well, what to do from here?

I do think that the EUR rally was mostly the result of short covering, and I have used the opportunity to add a tiny bit to my short position. Ultimately I am extremely bearish on the Euro and that on a relative basis, the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet is going to expand less quickly and that the ECB&#8217;s is going to stabilize. I had gotten a little too excited about the possibility of a rate cut, but nothing has changed in the bigger picture. Yesterday&#8217;s rally simply offers a much better entry point.

But, if I am wrong, and the ECB stays overly tight, then I have added another leg to my trade in an attempt to hedge a little.

I used the EuroStoxx rally to short that index. I was already short, but I added to the trade. That has pushed my book a little too net short, so I used the morning&#8217;s slight outpeformance of the Eurostoxx vs the S&P500 to cover the rest of my S&P short and replace it with Eurostoxx.

You will see that the two indexes have been tracking fairly closely over the last couple of months:<figure id="attachment_13601" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

If the ECB stays tight, then I think at the very least, the Eurostoxx will hopefully under perform the S&P 500. So if I am wrong with the EUR, hopefully the short stock leg will help ease the pain.

I kick myself for not being more patient and instead of being offside and playing from a weak hand with the rest of the hedge funds, I should have been initiating my short position in the Euro into yesterday&#8217;s strength.   Live and learn.  I am going to try to trade without worrying about the terrible entry and simply focus on the what I still believe is a good long term risk reward to the short side of the Euro.

**Positions**

**UPDATE: Short Euro.** On Friday I initiated a short position in the Euro. Yesterday I added a tiny amount to the trade. Conviction 4

**UPDATE: Short S&P 500.    **Covered all of my position yesterday and replaced it with short Eurostoxx.

**UPDATE: Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Added to the trade into yesterday&#8217;s ramp. Conviction level: 5. No stop for now.

****UPDATE: Short Yen.****  Gingerly re-entering the short side throughout this week. Yesterday continued to sell Yen. Will finish putting on position today.  Conviction 4

**Short JGB futures.  **I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
