I am late writing about this, but I feel that I have to mention it as the sheer absurdity of the comments give me great concern.  This week-end Japanese Economic Minister Akira Amari said (from the The Japan Times):

> “It will be important to show our mettle and see the Nikkei reach the 13,000 mark by the end of the fiscal year (March 31),”

> “We want to continue taking (new) steps to help stock prices rise” further, Amari stressed, referring to the core policies of the Liberal Democratic Party administration — the promotion of bold monetary easing, fiscal spending and greater private sector investment.

> Amari said the Nikkei’s recent surge translates into combined share appraisal gains of some ¥38 trillion among domestic corporations, including financial institutions.

Take a moment and really reflect on these comments.  This is the Japanese Economics Minister openly targeting Nikkei price levels.  That would be like Henry Paulson or Timothy Geithner saying that they want the S&P 500 to be 2,000 by year end.  Geez Louise&#8230;  That is insane.

This has to be some of the stupidest policy I have seen in a long, long time.

First of all, what does the level of the Nikkei have to do with the Japanese economy?  The Japanese Government could simply print Yen and buy Nikkei futures to achieve their price target, but how does that help the typical Japanese citizen?  A specific Nikkei level does not necessarily correlate with a level of economic growth.

Stock market appreciation is the result of sound economic policies, not the other way round.

I am all for the Japanese stimulating their economy, but to target the stock market is ridiculous.  I believe they should engage in Quantitative Easing, but not to goose their stock market higher, but to help their economy recover from the overly high Japanese Yen.  The stock market level should merely be a reflection of this policy.

The other amazing part of this surreal comment by the Economic Minister is the fact that the Japanese have actually barely changed their economic policies.  Almost all of this Yen depreciation / stock market rally has been the result of market participants _anticipating_ the coming changes in policies.

So instead of talking about policies that they are actually going to implement, the Economic Minister instead tries to further jaw bone the Nikkei higher.

The current Japanese Government individuals are dangerously naive.

I am not sure how this is going to play out, but I do know one thing &#8211; the market, never, ever, not in a million years, makes things this easy.

I am becoming increasingly concerned that the Japanese Government&#8217;s policies are going to end badly &#8211; really badly&#8230;  Not sure yet how to play it, but they are on the wrong track.
