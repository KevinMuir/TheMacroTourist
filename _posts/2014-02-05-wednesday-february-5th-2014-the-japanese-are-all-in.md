Last week I committed one of trading&#8217;s cardinal sins by playing for a counter trend rally in Yen, even though the long term fundamentals and technicals all pointed downward. I was aware of the risks, but really felt that a rally was coming. The Market Gods decided that while I had broken the rules, I still offered the appropriate amount of respect, so they let me get away with it. It turned out to be a good trade and yesterday I covered the position in its entirety. After all, the Market Gods only allow so much sinning before you feel their wrath.

Although I understand that the short side of the Yen is one of the most crowded trades out there, it is with good reason. It is one of the few really clear macro themed trades that can be put on in size where most government officials and market participants are aligned towards the same goal.

The reasons for my long trade were that I was nervous about the Yen because the American Treasury Secretary made some comments about the problems through solving your economic problems through devaluation. I viewed this as the first shot across the bow for the Japanese, and given the oversold nature of the Yen, I felt that a counter trend move higher was probably a high probability.

I still think that we are entering into a period where the Japanese&#8217; attempt at devaluing their way to prosperity is going to create more conflict between Japan and other nations, but there can be no denying that the Japanese are &#8220;all in&#8221; on this strategy.



Abe-conomics, for right or wrong, is going to make or break the Japanese economy. One of my business partner&#8217;s biggest worry is that the Japanese people are going to turn on Abe (as they do on every Prime Minister) and that the massively expansionary policies are going to be forsaken. Although I acknowledge that this is a risk, I think that the Japanese people are very acquiescent &#8211; almost to a fault. I think it takes a lot to turn their public opinion, but that once they agree on a direction, they continue in that direction far longer than most would ever guess. Take the last two decades for example. Do you think the Americans would have ever put up with 20 years of asset prices falling? They could barely take 2 years before they were printing like mad. The Japanese patiently endured two decades of stagnation before the tsunami / nuclear accident finally pushed them into action. The Japanese are not going to turn the ship around at the first sign of rough water. No, if anything, they are going to accelerate and do more.

After all, what choice do they have? Their economy is a huge indebted mess. Their demographics are terrible. Their chance of being able to make it out of this quagmire without a massive reset is very low. It is like an extreme skier who finds himself in a very precarious position half way down the mountain. To climb back up is risky and dangerous. To ski down is even more dangerous &#8211; but at least it is downhill. Don&#8217;t kid yourself, the Japanese are &#8220;all in&#8221; and they are not going to climb back up &#8211; they are going to simply point &#8217;em downhill and let &#8217;em run.

Yesterday I spoke about how I thought the ECB was going to stabilize the size of their balance sheet, while the Federal Reserve was in the process of reducing the rate of increase, with the eventual goal to to keep it stable. The Bank of Japan has no such reduction planned. In fact, the market is busy anticipating an increase in the size of their QE program.

The BoJ has a plan to continue their expansion until deflationary psychology is permanently eradicated.

And you can see that determination in the fact that they have pushed Japanese 10 year bonds to a level where they are now yielding almost 100 basis points under inflation:<figure id="attachment_12931" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Stop and think about that for a second. The Japanese 10 year is yielding a full 1% less than the going rate on inflation. Not only that, the Japanese government has pledged to take inflation even higher!

The financial repression is massive. It is the same sort of crazy negative real rate that the US experienced during their massive post credit 2008 bubble safety flight:<figure id="attachment_12941" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-12941" alt="US10YRRRFeb0414.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/US10YRRRFeb0414.png" width="600" height="340" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/US10YRRRFeb0414-300x170.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/US10YRRRFeb0414.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/US10YRRRFeb0414.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">US 10 Year Real Rate &#8211; not such a &#8220;safe&#8221; trade after all</figcaption></figure> 

I remember this time well. Regardless of the fact that investors were locking in a negative real rate of return, they continued to flock to supposed &#8220;safe&#8221; fixed income.

This massive flight into bonds ended up skinning investors alive as the bond market eventually backed up to more reasonable real rates of return, thus crushing the &#8220;safe&#8221; trade.

The same thing will happen in Japan. In fact, the ultimate bond bear market is going to be all the worse given their terrible economic and demographic situation.

Although some investors are confident that Abe will be able to steer the Japanese economy through this challenging period, I think that it is a disaster in the making. Make no mistake, Abe has no choice. It was either; continue on with the status quo which would eventually bankrupt the nation or do something different and bold. Abe-conomics probably won&#8217;t work, but the alternative of the status quo was definitely not going to work. Might as well take a shot at trying to grow your way out of your problems.

However, eventually the Japanese are going to lose control of their currency and bond market. Right now they are actively trying to move their currency lower. This is a dangerous slippery slope. It won&#8217;t take much for them to be in the same situation as the Emerging Market countries who are desperately trying to keep their currencies from collapsing and their interest rates from spiking.

Yesterday I shorted a tiny little bit extra of the JGB futures. Yes, I am selling into a new high, but it was small and I am willing to sit through the pain. Eventually this trade is going to be a huge winner. Right now no one can see anything except the fact that the BoJ is buying $80 billion of bonds every month, but the same thing was happening in the US and the bond market still fell.

Math is math. A negative real rate is a terrible price to buy a bond. It is a greater fool trade. You only buy it with the hope to sell it to someone else at a higher price. In the long run, the trade will lose. The only question is timing. I am not nearly smart enough to know the timing, so I will just do a little more at this better level and wait it out.

But the trade that I want to focus on is the Yen. I know that I was just long, and covered it only yesterday, but I want to gingerly dip my toe in on the short side. I am aware that flipping sides so quickly does seem to be tempting the Market Gods just a little too much, but I am going to go slow and ease into the trade.

At the end of the day, the right trade is to be short Yen. The fundamentals and technicals line up, and apart from an oversold condition that has now been worked off, it is tough to make the case that in the long run the Yen won&#8217;t find itself much lower.

I think the relative balance sheets between the BoJ and the Fed are going to continue to drive the Yen lower (higher USDJPY rate):<figure id="attachment_12951" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

You will notice that it has tracked fairly well. I see no reason for this to change. The US is on a course to decrease the rate of increase, while the Japanese are set to expand their expansion.

Not only that, but hopefully this week long correction might have shaken out some of the weak Yen shorts and helped from a sentiment perspective.

I am also long Japanese Yen volatility, which will make hopefully make money if things get really squirrelly (which before it is all over, I fully expect to happen).

So, against my better judgement, I am also going to start a short Yen position, with the thought of putting the first of it on between 101 and 102. If it rallies to the 100 level, I will add to the trade. There is no rush and I will be putting the position on opportunistically during the coming week.<figure id="attachment_12961" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

It seems like the Yen has already moved a lot, and it is scary to climb aboard such a firmly developed trend. But you need to remember that in the big picture, the move is barely a blip:<figure id="attachment_12971" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Shorting Yen &#8211; ready to do more if it goes against me.

<hr size="2" width="85%" />

**Positions**

****UPDATE: Short Yen.****  Covered all my long position yesterday. Starting today and over the next week, I will gingerly re-enter the short side. Conviction 1

**UPDATE: Short JGB futures.** Added small to this trade yesterday. I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Short Euro.** On Friday I initiated a short position in the Euro. Conviction 4

**Short S&P 500.    **I covered half of my position on Friday, and although it was still a good trade, let&#8217;s hope I don&#8217;t take off the other half right before the next big dip!  Conviction 2

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
