Although last week Yellen stood up in front of the Senate and spoke about the benefits of QE, there can be no denying that more and more economists and market watchers are questioning its efficacy. 

This op-ed in the WSJ from the former Fed&#8217;s Mortgage Back QE head is indicative of this realization:

> I can only say: I&#8217;m sorry, America. As a former Federal Reserve official, I was responsible for executing the centerpiece program of the Fed&#8217;s first plunge into the bond-buying experiment known as quantitative easing. The central bank continues to spin QE as a tool for helping Main Street. But I&#8217;ve come to recognize the program for what it really is: the greatest backdoor Wall Street bailout of all time.
> 
> Even when acknowledging QE&#8217;s shortcomings, Chairman Bernanke argues that some action by the Fed is better than none (a position that his likely successor, Fed Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen, also embraces). The implication is that the Fed is dutifully compensating for the rest of Washington&#8217;s dysfunction. But the Fed is at the center of that dysfunction. Case in point: It has allowed QE to become Wall Street&#8217;s new &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; policy.

At the centre of the problem with QE is that the transmission mechanism is broken. The Fed is piling money into the system, but it isn&#8217;t going anywhere. Instead of making loans, it is collecting as excess reserves in the banking system:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/excessreservesNov1813.png" alt="ExcessreservesNov1813" title="excessreservesNov1813.png" border="0" width="600" height="360" />

We are now 5 years after the &#8220;emergency measures&#8221; were put in place after the credit crisis, yet QE continues. It is truly flabbergasting. 

Over the last six months, we have seen Fed Governors express some unease with the size of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet, and although they have been quiet lately as they let Yellen slip through the nomination process, **there is no way that they are comfortable with the recent market action.**

I expect that as soon as practically possible there will be a raft of Governors who come out with some very hawkish tapering statements.

Not only that, but after Yellen gets nominated I expect there to be a dramatic shift in the direction of Federal Reserve policy. No they will not get less easy, but there will be experimentation with different forms of stimulus. No longer will they rely on QE programs as heavily. The QE2, Operation Twist and QE3 policies have been less effective than the Fed would have hoped from an economic point of view, and from a political standpoint they have been complete failures. The average American now sees the Fed as merely Wall Street&#8217;s lackey that continues to enrich the fat cats. 

Yellen&#8217;s Fed will work on encouraging the excess reserves on the banks books to find their way into the system. The Fed will also experiment with lending more directly into the economy, eliminating the banks from the equation. The Fed will realize that the fractional reserve banking system is no longer functioning properly and simply stuffing more money into it makes no sense.

I suspect that after trying the trick of trying to flatten the yield curve through forward guidance, the Yellen Fed will eventually cut interest on reserves. Right now the Fed pays 25 basis points for deposits from member banks. By eliminating this interest, the banks would be forced to find productive uses for those excess reserves. I could even envision the Fed going negative for this rate, making those excess reserves truly hot potatoes.

Although a lot of market watchers think that Yellen is going to keep QE going for quite some time, I suspect that the market will be surprised by a fairly swift change of direction. 

Ultimately I think the alternative measures will be much more stimulative, but there will be some hiccups when the market first comes to realize that the status quo will not continue for as long as they anticipate. 

The Fed is no fool, even if they don&#8217;t say it out loud, they realize that the current plan is not working. They have already made a big mistake and the market is very quickly running way ahead of itself. The Fed&#8217;s mandate is to foster economic growth and keep inflation low. It is not to prop up the stock market.

My suspicion is that Yellen&#8217;s Fed is going to be much more different, for the simple fact that the current plan is not working &#8211; and everyone knows it.
