Last week the stock market finally rolled over. Everyone had different reasons to explain the weakness, but the truth of the matter is that we were due and the market was going to find a reason.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="SPXJan2714.gif" alt="SPXJan2714" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/SPXJan2714.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">S&P &#8211; finally a dip&#8230; but is it a buying opportunity or the start of a bigger correction?</figcaption></figure> 

I have been fortunate enough to be short, and now I am faced with the task of deciding whether this was the correction needed to cleanse an extended bull move before it can resume its advance, or whether this is the start of something more serious.

This week-end as I flipped through all my research and trading commentaries, I was struck by how complacent the bulls are regarding Thursday and Friday&#8217;s stock market action. In the few conversations that I have had with other traders, I am also surprised at the complete lack of concern that this is anything more than a one or two day blip.

There seems to be an overwhelming consensus that this dip is a great buying opportunity and that the uptrend will resume in a twinkling of an eye.

They very well might be right. This bull market has astounded me and I have been shocked at the ferocity of the move higher over the last quarter.

But I wish I could be as sure of anything (let alone the direction of the market) as the bulls seem to be regarding their certainty about this great dip buying opportunity. I am not even sure my dog likes me as much as the bulls are sure that you need to pull out the blue tickets by the fistful.

I do understand why they are so bullish. If you look at the short term studies, everything points to Friday&#8217;s swoon as being over done. Statistically, the right call is to play for a bounce. But there are all sorts of time when the &#8220;right play&#8221; didn&#8217;t work. The fact that everyone is so convinced this time it will work, fills me with dread.

Although at the time, I was only 17 years old and more interested in the latest New Order 12&#8243; single or helping to Save Ferris!, I have read every book I can about the 1987 crash that I could lay my hands on.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

One thing that I distinctly remember is that the market traded terribly on the Friday before the crash. It closed at the lows and was down almost 5% on the day. Many investment professionals actually _celebrated_ the big down day because the much anticipated correction _was finally over._ Then the market gapped down on Monday and many professionals actually bought the gap down as, in general, providing liquidity into this sort of panic is the right trade. They did the &#8220;right trade&#8221;, but yet the market proceeded to never recover and closed down over 20% on the day.

Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am not predicating a crash. The 1987 crash was a perfect storm of negative events that produced a very unique market reaction.

However, I think that the bulls who are all salivating over Friday&#8217;s decline are overly confident.

The current bull market is extremely old in terms of age. Have a look at this great chart from the blog The Short Side of Long:<figure style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img class=" " style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="BullMarketLengthJan2514.jpg" alt="BullMarketLengthJan2514" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/BullMarketLengthJan2514.jpg" width="580" height="338" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Length of the various bull markets (in weeks)</figcaption></figure> 

Could this go longer? Of course! Is it a good bet? I don&#8217;t think so.

Especially when you understand the extremely lopsided sentiment:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="InvestorIntJan2514.png" alt="InvestorIntJan2514" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/InvestorIntJan2514.png" width="600" height="420" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Investors Intelligence Survey &#8211; Bull/Bear ratio all time highs!</figcaption></figure> 

It is not like valuations are supportive of equities either. Have a look at the expected returns from my favourite quantitative shop GMO:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="GMOForecastJan2514.png" alt="GMOForecastJan2514" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/GMOForecastJan2514.png" width="600" height="428" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">GMO 7 year asset class forecast &#8211; negative forecasted returns for US equities</figcaption></figure> 

These negative forecasted returns indicates that the market is priced at a level that offers very little fundamental value.

The bulls will argue that all of these arguments could have been made anytime over the last 6 months and that you would have missed out on this great move higher.

Absolutely correct.

The market has had a monster move higher in the face of many obstacles. It seemed to be going up simply because it was going up.

Except, it isn&#8217;t anymore&#8230;

Which brings us back to my dilemma regarding what to do with my short position. The other day I was having a discussion with a colleague about my trading shortcomings. As you might have noticed, I have lots. We were talking about ways to improve them. One of my biggest problems is that, at times, I &#8220;fight&#8221; the market too much. Over the last month, I have been &#8220;fighting&#8221; the market&#8217;s advance.  Although I was managing my risk, I was definitely on the other side of most investors&#8217; bullish stance.  My colleague&#8217;s suggestion was that maybe I should wait until it turns before selling it. I told him that it was never that easy and that if he knew when it had rolled over as opposed to just dipped, I would be all ears.

Back to today. Has it rolled over? Or is it just a dip?

I don&#8217;t know, but I am sure thankful that I haven&#8217;t been playing the long side.  The late longs today find themselves offside and hoping for a rally.

Thursday and Friday seemed to come out of nowhere, and it caught most everyone off guard. Although I was happy about it, I was not expecting it.

It was very difficult to &#8220;know&#8221; when that big down day is upon us. Previous to Friday, every morning dip was a buying opportunity for the inevitable afternoon rally.  It works until it doesn&#8217;t and Friday was the first day in a long time that it didn&#8217;t work.

Is this correction another buying opportunity as the bulls attest? Or is this dip the long awaited signal for those that were bearish that the time to press their luck is upon us?

I am not nearly smart enough to either &#8220;buy this dip because this every dip has been a great opportunity&#8221; or to &#8220;wait until it rolls over to climb aboard.&#8221;

I am just going to be thankful that I don&#8217;t need to decide and that I can see what happens from here. If I end up missing the lows on my short position, so be it. If the market does gather steam to the downside, then the worst that I will have to contend with is when to ring the register.

I realize that this is a bit of a cop out. But I guess my point is that today, it is very difficult to &#8220;know&#8221; what to do. Those that are certain are fools. I would tend to say that you need to go with the numbers, which means that today should be bought. However we are already up 9 S&P points and the market very well could open at the highs and then roll over.

The risks have clearly risen. The nice quiet relentless bull market has been dealt its first bad set of cards. If I didn&#8217;t have a position, then I would say the odds favour a short term rally, but that I would be using any strength to either get short or reduce exposure. I still believe that the bulls have had way too many good cards and their luck is about to turn.

**Things that I am watching&#8230;**

**World Financial Markets Weekly Summary for the week of Jan 20-24, 2014**

<p style="text-align: center;">

The commodity countries&#8217; stock markets did best last week, with Australia&#8217;s and Canada&#8217;s markets declining the least. At the other end of the spectrum, last week was the week that Europe finally stopped out performing. The three worst indexes were Germany&#8217;s DAX, France&#8217;s CAC an the Spanish IBEX. The SX5E index is simply the European large cap index, so it obviously suffered in proportion.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The world&#8217;s bond market had a good week, with only the Italian bond market posting losses.

<hr size="2" width="85%" />

**Positions**

**Short S&P 500.    **So far it looks like I didn&#8217;t need to worry about sitting through new highs as late last week the market rolled over pretty hard. Hanging tough and trying to let it cook. Conviction: 4

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

****Long Yen.****  This is a counter trend trade where I am just begging the Market Gods to punish me.  However, I do believe that the Yen is oversold and due for a move higher.  The Americans shot across the bow might very well be the catalyst. **The Yen has started to move my way with the risk off move last week. For now I sit tight.****** **Conviction: 2.  **Stops are last weeks low in Yen terms.

**Short Canadian dollar.**   Conviction level: 3. Also **Short CAD against JPY and EUR.**  Small position size.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various natural gas contracts.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather. Conviction level: 3 No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
