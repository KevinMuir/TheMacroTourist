Ever since the advent of the Fed&#8217;s first Quantitative Easing program at the end of 2008, I have been continually perplexed with the financial community&#8217;s belief that the QE programs cause long term interest rates to move lower. The conventional wisdom is that since the Fed is creating additional fixed income demand, the price must rise and interest rates fall.

Let&#8217;s a have a look and see how this has worked in practice. Here is the chart of the US Treasury 10 year yield. I have outlined the three different QE programs in shaded rectangles:<figure id="attachment_13751" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I don&#8217;t know what everyone else sees that I don&#8217;t, but it sure looks to me that each QE program has started with a lower yield and has ended with a higher one. Not only that, but the periods without QE seem to have the yield declining&#8230;

But, but, but&#8230; that can&#8217;t be&#8230;

Well it is, so you can see why I remain perplexed why everyone thinks that the Fed&#8217;s QE programs _have to cause yields to fall._

If you step back and think about the QE programs, it becomes much more clear as to why these programs are far from long term bond market bullish.

During a time of de-levering, the natural state of the economy is for debt to be paid down, for credit to be destroyed. Absent aggressive government policies, the economy would rebalance at a lower price level and we would have a cleansing flush of defaults. However, the government is resisting this rebalancing and continues to attempt to expand the money supply through Quantitative Easing programs.

If the QE programs are successful, they are by their very definition inflationary. That is their whole purpose.

And what is the sovereign bond investor&#8217;s worst enemy? Inflation (although I guess default would be their worst enemy, but let&#8217;s assume that the US government is good for their debts).

Inflation is the one true bogeyman of the long term bond investor. If inflation expectations rise, then bond investors will demand more yield to compensate for their decreased purchasing power.

With the QE3 program, the Fed might be buying $75 billion of bonds each month, but what about all the other _existing bond stock?_ There is almost $18 trillion of existing Federal debt. Then think about all the other debt that is priced off the government benchmark. According to the St. Louis Federal Reserve there is almost $60 trillion of total credit.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="TCDOFeb1014.jpg" alt="TCDOFeb1014" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/TCDOFeb1014.jpg" width="600" height="364" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">US Total Credit Outstanding</figcaption></figure> 

This is a hugely overly simplistic example, but think about what happens if the Fed alters inflation expectations enough to cause just 1% of the existing bond holders to sell and move into another asset? The amount of selling would be $600 billion. That shift completely dwarfs the increase in demand from the Fed&#8217;s QE programs.

The goal of the QE programs is to jump start the economy enough for the deflationary cycle to be stopped. The Fed hopes that the velocity of money will stop going down and that the expanded monetary base will kick start a self reinforcing growth cycle.

I am not sure if they are going to be successful, but I do know one thing, the idea that QE is bond friendly is just misplaced overly simplistic thinking.

On the other hand, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the bond market can&#8217;t go down in the face of declining QE programs. It might be that eventually the Fed&#8217;s pump priming will work and that the massive amount of monetary base that has been force fed into the system will ignite and cause inflation to really take off.

A lot of investors have been confused by the recent bond market reaction to the introduction of tapering. Although many say that the bond market was initially backing up because of tapering, I think the bond market was actually backing up on improved economic expectations. Now that we are actually experiencing tapering, the bond market is rallying as the market prices in an increased chance of the de-levering natural state returning.

In the coming months. if the Fed decides to ease up on the taper, the knee jerk reaction will be to buy the bond market. If that does indeed happen, I will use the bond market rally to sell into.  I don&#8217;t buy the theory that QE programs are bond market friendly.  If anything, it seems like the best time to buy bonds is when QE ends.

**Update on short stock position**

I have been fortunate to be leaning short both US and European stock markets over the last month.   In the last week or so, I have been slowly picking away at covering the position, and coming into Friday, I was only short European stocks.

I am not turning bullish, but I no longer feel as bearish.  At this stage, I just don&#8217;t know where we are headed, so on Friday after the positive reaction to the bad US employment report, I hedged up my short European stocks by buying S&P 500 futures.  I still believe that the ECB is being overly tight and that the EuroStoxx is going to under perform, but I am no longer confident that the global stock markets are headed lower.  I am going to get neutral on a delta basis and just watch for a little bit.

**Positions**

**UPDATE: Short European stocks via ESTX50 index vs Long S&P 500.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities.   **On Friday I turned this into a spread trade by buying S&P 500 futures on the other side.  There is no longer any delta associated with the position and it is purely a relative performance trade.  **Conviction 5

**Short Euro.  **Not much to say, I didn&#8217;t enter this trade very well, but I still think the Euro works it way lower in coming months. Conviction 4

****Short Yen.****  Establish short Yen last week.  Now I will sit tight and wait.  Conviction 4

**Short JGB futures.  **I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
