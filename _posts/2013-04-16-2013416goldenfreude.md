### Goldenfreude

**** &#8211; Barry Ritholz who writes the terrific [The Big Picture](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/) blog coined this great word to describe the delight that many financial pundits that have long been skeptical of gold are experiencing after gold&#8217;s massive crash.

I understand why so many are rubbing their hands with glee.  Gold bugs are an annoying bunch.  Their arguments are not usually based on any sort of constructive analysis, but instead border more on a sort of religious belief.  What always frustrate me about these arguments is that there is no sense of a measure of value.  Gold should just be bought, regardless of the price.  To a gold bug it doesn&#8217;t matter if gold is trading at $1,000 or $10,000, it should be bought!   It is very much akin to annoying real estate evangelists who only espouse buying some, more or lots of real estate because it is such a great investment.  The reality is that gold, real estate or any asset for that matter can be a great investment depending on the price.

Unless there is a change in the underlying fundamentals, a decline in a price of an asset should make it more attractive.  It is ironic that as gold has gone lower, it has become less desirable in the eyes of most investors.  It is also deeply troubling that so many pundits seem to be rejoicing so gleefully in the failure of the precious metal to protect the gold bugs from the problems in the financial system.

The Market Gods do not take kindly to those that take pleasure in another&#8217;s pain, no matter how annoying the gold bugs were in the past.  So for those that are revelling in the stupidity of the gold bugs&#8217; pain, I caution them to beware of the old expression about glass houses.

This morning, I read this great piece by one of my favourite writers Mark Grant which argued that this decline in gold was the result of somebody **VERY** big being in **A LOT** of trouble.  I agree completely and actually had speculated the same to my buddies on Friday afternoon.  The gold bugs like to say this was &#8216;orchestrated&#8217; by the Federal Reserve and other Central Banks to keep gold down.  Well, I call bullshit on that one.  The Federal Reserve has much better things to do than to manipulate the price of gold.  They have a trillion dollar bond market that they need to rig.  But there is no doubt that gold is an asset that is held by many governments, and that those governments are in dire financial shape.  Although many has speculated that Cyprus selling their gold might have caused the sell off, they are not large enough.  I am thinking that there must be a global liquidity shortage that is causing all Central Banks to back away, while at the same time, the desperate few are trying to raise cash in away means they can.

I believe that the gold smash is extremely worrisome for all asset classes and all countries.  If gold had collapsed because Central Banks had decided that the era of ZIRP was over and returned real rates to appropriately positive levels, then I wouldn&#8217;t be so quick to fade the gold decline.  However, the reality is actually just the opposite.  Central banks are increasingly pushing real interest rates to even more negative levels.  The decline in gold is not due to a change in fundamentals, but a change in liquidity that has shaken off a lot of weak investors.

Also as the price has collapsed, we have sailed right down through the marginal cost of production for many mines.  From a Bloomberg article:

>  “Below $1,300 gold, about 30 to 40 percent of mine production is probably not cash-flow positive,” Joseph Wickwire, the Boston-based manager of Fidelity Investments’ Select Gold Portfolio fund which has about $2.14 billion under management, said yesterday in a telephone interview.&#8221;

> &#8220;Gold companies’ balance sheets could experience “significant pain” if gold has a sustained slide under $1,300 an ounce, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note yesterday. RBC estimates the average all-in costs for North American gold producers at about $1,200 an ounce.     “We would expect all the gold producers in our coverage universe to cut all discretionary expenses, cut capital spending sharply, defer new capital development programs and in some cases cut dividends” at that level, RBC’s Stephen Walker, Dan Rollins and Sam Crittenden said in the note.&#8221;

If the gold price stays here, the new supply is going to dramatically shrink.  When you shut down a mine, the gold is still there 5 or 10 years later.  There is no need to mine it at low prices.

Let&#8217;s recap: A much lower price that makes it more attractive, not less.  A huge over confidence by the shorts that borders on downright mean.  A price that is close to being below the cost of production.  Although it feels terrible, it is time to buy gold, not sell it.

I continue to be worried about a deflationary collapse, so I like the trade especially against a short S&P 500 futures position.  So far on this spread trade, I am long and wrong.  However, I will take the other side of those engaging in Goldenfreude any day of the week.

And I will leave you with this great picture Zero Hedge ran&#8230;
