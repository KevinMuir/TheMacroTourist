Over the last couple weeks the markets have been focused on the stunning change in the Japanese monetary policy.  The completely unprecedented amount of stimulus that is being applied to their economy has captured the attention of all macro traders.  For the Europeans this couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time.

It was only a few weeks ago that the one two punch of the Italian election outcome and the Cyprus credit crisis threatened to unleash another Euro crisis.  However, the massive Japanese liquidity that has been set loose seems to have put those issues on the back burner.  But has anything really changed in Europe?

I would contend that although the Japanese liquidity is most likely providing some temporary support to all asset markets throughout the globe, this reprise will prove very short lived in Europe especially.

The Japanese Yen&#8217;s decline is going to make it increasingly difficult for European export economies to compete with Japan.  The Europeans need a higher EURJPY about as much as Lindsay Lohan needs another drink.  They are already suffering tremendously due to poor domestic demand and this increase in their currency versus their biggest export competitor is going to make the problem all that much worse.

In regards to Cyprus, although the problem has been removed from the front page, the precedents that were set during this crisis will cause lasting damage to the European financial system that will be almost impossible to repair.  Although the Troika eventually did not demand haircuts on insured deposits, the fact that the original deal had them as a solution will not be lost on the peripheral European nations.  These nations are already having difficulty attracting capital,  and now the Troika has pretty well now guaranteed that no one will ever trust a PIIGS bank again.  This will only serve to slow down the velocity of money all the more, thus weakening the already fragile European economy.

As for Italy, the problem is not solved by any means and the fact that a comedian whose main platform was a plan to leave the Euro garnered so much support should not be lost on investors.  The public opinion of the costs of staying in the Euro is swinging against the Eurocrats in Brussels.  This trend is only going to get worse, not better going forward.

All of this economic uncertainty has taken its toll on the European economy.  This is most evident in this chart that many have labelled the &#8216;scariest chart in Europe&#8217;:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/5162b92be4b080e51178db5b/1365424428428/20121206_EUYouth%20Apr%2008%2013.jpg" />

As you can see, the unemployment is skyrocketing in these peripheral European nations.  If there was ever a recipe for disaster, it is having millions of unemployed young males wandering the streets with very little hopes of actually being able to find a job and start their lives.

The European countries are on a collision course with economic Armageddon, yet the Troika and the other Eurocrats seem to continually make decisions that only worsen the problem.

At this point you might be saying to yourself, that&#8217;s great Kevin, but right now the market doesn&#8217;t care, so why should I?  Well, right you are.  But I believe that you should be using this surge in liquidity from the Japanese euphoria to be establishing European short positions.

I am already short European stocks versus long everything or anything else, along with short French OATs against long Bunds.  The stock position has been working nicely, but the French spread trade has been a complete disaster.

Over the last two weeks, the French bond market has been one of the best performing bond markets out there.  My guess is that the Cyprus situation has created a lot of uncertainty that has forced deposits from banks into sovereign paper.  Although the French economy is performing terribly, their sovereign bonds were yielding more than German paper and they are still considered a good credit.  So for now, the market seemed to be assigning a &#8216;safe haven&#8217; property to France.

It seems amazing that the French bond market is yielding as little as it is:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/FR%2010%20YR%20Apr%2008%2013.gif" />

A bond market yielding less than 2% for a country whose economic situation is as precarious as France&#8217;s seems absurd.  Their economy is one of the worst performing European nations.  Have a look at their PMI over the last few years:

Their unemployment also just continues to deteriorate:

Currently the economic weakness is having a traditional bond positive market reaction in the French financial markets, but I feel that there is an increased chance that as the next European shoe drops, the market will eventually realize that the French economic situation is just as precarious as Italy&#8217;s or Spain&#8217;s.  At that point, the French 10 year will spike to levels that are more in line with those nations.

Therefore, I am going to use this French OAT strength to add to my position.  However, instead of adding to it with a long German short OATs position, I am going to introduce a new position of long US Treasuries versus short French OATs.

Here is a chart of this spread:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/FR%20US%2010%20Yr%20Sp%20Apr%2008%2013.gif" />

The French OATs yield is basically right on top of the US Treasury yield.  I don&#8217;t think that this is appropriate and given my belief that financial markets are becoming more unstable, I think this spread has the potential to revert to levels from a year ago of more than 200 basis points.
