This morning my inbox is filled with research proclaiming that the Euro crisis has turned the corner and that the growth trajectory is firmly in place.  The catalyst for the latest European bull market bandwagon jumping is the release of the economic confidence figures for the Euro area.  The confidence level came in at 89.2 from a revised 87.8 in December, but most importantly was higher than the expected 88.2.

Economists are as usual applying their crack forecasting abilities to simply extrapolate the recent trends (from a Bloomberg article):

> “Thanks to Mario Draghi’s confidence trick, the euro zone has recently gone through a period of calm,” Carsten Brzerski, senior economist at ING Group in Brussels, wrote in a note.  “Financial markets are cheerful, private capital is returning to euro-zone peripheral countries and structural reforms seem to bear some fruits.  This is what Mario Draghi called ‘positive contagion.’”

> “The series of positive surprises on euro-zone survey releases in January support our growth scenario,” Evelyn Herrmann, European economist at BNP Paribas SA in London, wrote in a emailed note.

I have written before how the European economy is far from out of the woods, but today the forest does not seem to be anywhere in sight.

Into this morning&#8217;s Euro-ptimism is a great opportunity to add to my &#8216;short Europe long anything else position&#8217;.

Last year I remember harping on how the Japanese economy could not handle the relentless Yen strength.  I remember punching up a chart of the Euro / Yen rate and questioning how Toyota could possibly compete with Volkswagon when the Euro had declined by almost 50% versus the Yen since 2008.  The answer was of course that they couldn’t.  It took a change of government in Japan, but eventually they figured it out and the Japanese have now aggressively started the process of devaluing their currency.

The effects have been most pronounced against the Euro &#8211; which clinging to the Germanic principles, the ECB has refused to expand their balance sheet as aggressively as the other major Central Banks:

The Euro has exploded upwards against the Yen and just like the Japanese economy could not handle the currency strength, neither will the European economy be able to handle this massive move on their currency against one of their biggest trading adversaries.

The markets might not figure this out right away, but make no mistake, the relative tightness of the ECB will eventually cause the European economy to slump badly.  I realize that I am suggesting that the country who does not engage in devaluation will suffer economic weakness.  I also understand that in the long run, all countries lose in currency wars.  But I am not in the business of deciding what &#8216;should be&#8217; but rather &#8216;what is&#8217;.  And &#8216;what is&#8217; is rather obvious to me.  The ECB is the tightest Central Bank out there.  **This will be extremely deflationary, especially on a relative basis.**

Therefore, I am adding to my position by shorting US 2 year bonds and buying German 2 year bunds.

Here is the chart of the yield spread:

You will notice that over the last month, as the European crisis has waned, there has been a massive move downward in this spread as German yields have converged with US yields.

If I am correct about the European economy, then they are facing years of a deflationary morass as they muddle through with their high debt loads, low growth rates, poorly designed union and overly tight Central Bank.  If I am correct about the US, then they are about to experience an upswing in growth as the years of highly accommodative monetary policy finally kick in combined with the cheap US dollar and other pent up demand.

If my scenario comes to fruition, then the US 2 year yield note is going to be yielding a lot more than the German 2 year note in the coming years.

I believe that the risk reward favours buying German 2s and selling US 2s because at the very least, I do not believe that the ECB can afford to allow the Euro to rally anymore.  We saw the recent comments from Juncker that the Euro was &#8216;dangerously high&#8217; &#8211; and that was at least 2 big figures ago.  The Euro seems to be tracking the spread between these two rates fairly closely:

In this chart I have plotted the inverse of the EUR to match the direction of the spread, so this weakness in the orange line is actually EUR strength.

If Juncker thinks that the EUR is too strong, and the Fed is not about to stop printing, then the only real answer is to join the party.  As usual, it all comes down to timing.  Since I am definitely catching the falling knife here, I am not going to put on my whole position and will use a further decline in the spread to add to the position.
