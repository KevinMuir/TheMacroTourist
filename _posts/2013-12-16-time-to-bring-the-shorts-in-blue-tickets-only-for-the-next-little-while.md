Last week I suggested getting short equity markets, anticipating that the increased worry about the possibility of a taper at this week&#8217;s Fed meeting would weigh on stocks.

I have been lucky enough to get this trade somewhat correct as we have retreated from the 1810 in the S&P 500 down to the 1775.

My plan was always to cover before the Fed meeting, and given that it is a two day meeting starting tomorrow, I am going to bring in my shorts this morning.

The timing of my purchases also coincides with a strong seasonal period for equity markets. The [CrossingWallStreet.com](http://www.crossingwallstreet.com/archives/2013/12/the-santa-claus-rally-season-is-about-to-begin.html) blog produced this great chart that outlined the tendency for the equity market to rally starting mid December:

I am going to err on being slightly long equities throughout the holiday period. I think that if we get a Fed taper, it will be small and accompanied by a Interest on Excess Reserves cut. The stock market might initially sell off, but I would be a buyer into the weakness as I think a fair amount of the taper is built into the price already. Not only that, the taper is such a small reduction in the amount of stimulus, I feel the market is very much overly concerned about the effect on the markets. If I am wrong and they don&#8217;t taper, then that will also be good news for equities. Combined with the strong seasonal bias during this period, I think that blue tickets are in order for the next little while.
