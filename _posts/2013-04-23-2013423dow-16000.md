This week-end Barron&#8217;s cover story was their annual &#8216;Big Money Poll.&#8217;  Financial pundits around the world had a field day with the fact that this survey witnessed the most bullish response from market professionals in the history of the magazine.

The cover just says it all:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/5176bed0e4b0e95e599ca4c1/1366736593946/Barrons%20Apr%2023%2013.com.jpg.jpg?format=original" />

My inbox was instantly filled with all sorts of bearish pieces about how this marked the top as everyone was already long.

Here is a representative sample from ConvertBond (I am not picking on him at all &#8211; in fact he is a great blogger, but in this case, his post was very representative of the type of research that this cover created):

I of course patted myself on the back for already being short and knowing that this was a situation where all good news was fully baked into the price of stocks.  I took comfort in my contrarianism.

However, this smugness sure hasn&#8217;t done me any good today as prices of stocks throughout the world have exploded higher.

The fact that so many were so keen to point out the failings of this Barron&#8217;s cover should have raised my antennae.  Being a contrarian is a tough game and tops are not made the day that magazines are published.  We probably sucked in a lot of weak bears on the Barron&#8217;s piece.

Even if this Barron&#8217;s piece is as accurate as previous bullish Big Money polls, you need to remember that the market did not top until many weeks after the piece ran.  Have a look at this great chart from Hussman:

Notice how in both cases the market took months before it rolled over.

I should have realized that this was most likely not the flashing warning sign that many were proclaiming it to be.

Don&#8217;t forget to keep time frames in mind when trying to top tick the market&#8230;
