A couple years back this weird technical signal called the Hindenburg Omen triggered.  Everyone got in quite a lather predicting the next crash.  Supposedly this signal had correctly called the 1987 crash and also the 2007 top.  I remember that when I did some research and actually looked at its track record I was far from impressed.  There seemed to be no predictive value in the trigger.  I was bullish and the selling that accompanied the hype surrounding this indicator provided the perfect entry point.  Of course the omen signal ended up being a dud, and most investors forgot about the fact that they had emptied their portfolio into a hole.

Fast forward to today.  We have now had the 5th time in the last 7 days of the Omen triggering.  Although ZeroHedge is reporting on the cluster of signals, most of the investing public are laughing at the conspiracy theorist / market site.

I have once again done some digging about the efficacy of the Hindenburg Omen.  Although one trigger has zero predictive value, a cluster (as we are experiencing now) is indeed bearish.

I have some statistical oriented trading newsletters that I purchase that outline the performance after this sort of cluster, but out of respect I am not going to post them (I just checked their free portion of their sites and they did not post it in that section).  To summarize, the more triggers, the better statistical edge.

It would be unbelievably ironic if this cluster ends up correctly signalling a top and that the investing public ignored this one and got it wrong, just like they got the last one wrong when they sold.

Often the market goes where it hurts the most amount of people.  I think we have hit a point where the pain trade is down.
