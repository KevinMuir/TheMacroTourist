This week in his investment letter &#8220;Things that make you go hmmm&#8230;.&#8221; the terrific writer Mark Grant reminds us about the US market&#8217;s trading after the Lehman bankruptcy.  Mark recaps how the market did not immediately fully understand the severity of the situation and took a few months to fully discount the problems.

I have long thought that documenting the charts for events such as the Lehman collapse is a great idea.  The ability to go back and remember how the market traded in reaction to these types of shocks is hugely valuable.

So I am going to start a new topic for my journal called &#8220;This Week in Market History&#8221;.  And I am going to steal Mark Grant&#8217;s idea by starting with the Lehman bankruptcy.

If you recall back to September 2008, everyone thought (including me) that Lehman would be rescued very much like Bear Stearns during the week-end of September 13/14th.  The market had actually rallied in the last hours of Friday September 12th on this expectation:

Although the market did in fact sell off hard on Sunday night after the bankruptcy was announced, what was amazing was the fact that by the end of the week the S&P 500 was almost where it had gone out the previous week.

The market had seemingly digested the Lehman bankruptcy and for a while Secretary Paulson&#8217;s comments that the market &#8216;had priced in&#8217; the ramifications of the collapse of the firm looked prescient.

However, the rally on Friday proved to be a huge sucker&#8217;s rally with the bulk of the losses still ahead.  Here is the daily chart of the S&P 500 ETF:

The lesson was that the market was far from efficient.  The full ramifications of the Lehman bankruptcy was not understood nor fully priced until many weeks later.
