The other day one of my good buddies that used to work with me on the sell side called me up to ask for some advice. Although he used to be an institutional equity trader, he now runs a hedge fund and wanted my advice on the best way to get long equity volatility. In our younger days, I ran the equity index book at a large Canadian bank, so he figured that I might have something to add in terms of executing his strategy.

Now when a hedge fund buddy calls you up to ask advice on the best way to implement his trade, the last thing you want to do is to tell him that although you like his trade, in terms of buying volatility, there is probably an even better trade out there. You don&#8217;t end up being a hedge fund manager by thinking that other people have better ideas than you, so on the whole, when one of these guys calls you up asking for advice implementing a trade &#8211; you simply give the advice and hope that you can help out a friend.

To my buddy&#8217;s credit, he wanted to buy equity volatility last week when the VIX was trading with a 12 handle. I am not sure of his time horizon, but I hope he executed it because from a short term trading perspective &#8211; he nailed the trade!<figure id="attachment_12121" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

But if he was using his long equity volatility position as a longer term hedge for his portfolio, then I think there are much better trades out there.

Over the last couple of decades there has been a remarkable increase in the knowledge of option trading by the professional investing community. Fifteen years ago when we were trading on the desk my buddy would have barely know the difference between gamma and vega. Today, with the advent of the myriad of different products that allow you to trade everything from weekly options to futures on implied volatility, the market has become increasingly sophisticated.

This ability to trade not only the options themselves, but the implied volatility of these options has created a whole new class of investors who are constantly buying vega to get long equity volatility as a hedge for their traditional equity portfolio.

The basic theory goes like this &#8211; when stocks experience a stressful decline, investors pay up for the privilege of hedging their portfolio. Equity volatility is therefore negatively correlated with equities. When your equity portfolio is experiencing a decline, the long volatility portion of the hedge should be showing a gain to offset some of the loss in the other side.

But the real problem is not that theory. I see a lot of merit in that strategy and can understand why a hedge fund might want to always be long volatility.

The real problem is 2008.

You see, before 2008, the market had experienced some turbulent moments. The 1987 crash and the Long Term Credit Crisis were two examples of periods where volatility soared. However, nothing compared to the 2008 credit crisis.

I traded through both the LTCM and the 2008 credit crisis. During the LTCM crisis I was trading for a bank with deep pockets, and I had a front row seat for the damage to the equity markets. Hedge funds were offside and desperate to pay up for protection. Although our proprietary book was also hurting, we were able to sit through the marks and when it came to volatility, we were able to keep selling all the way up. During the crisis we made what we thought were some obscene sales at prices that seemed to outrageous at the time. In the nadir of the panic, when a hedge fund wanted to buy some out of the money puts, we were able to sell a 40%+ vol and we were ecstatic. Before LTCM blew up, we thought 20% vol was a high five slapping sale. Now here we were selling 40s&#8230; And lucky for us, those sales did end up being as profitable as we hoped. The Fed stepped in and saved the system by forcing Wall Street dealers to stem the bleeding of LTCM and in doing so, stabilized the market, bringing volatilities back to earth.<figure id="attachment_12131" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-12131" alt="VIXLTCMJan3014.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/VIXLTCMJan3014.png" width="600" height="346" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/VIXLTCMJan3014-300x173.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/VIXLTCMJan3014.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/VIXLTCMJan3014.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">VIX Index during the time of the LTCM crisis</figcaption></figure> 

Although the markets did quiet down immediately after the LTCM bailout, in the next half dozen years we had the busting of the dot com bubble and then September 11th. Volatilities stayed somewhat higher, with periodic spikes into the 40s. It wasn&#8217;t until 2003 that things returned to a low volatility environment:<figure id="attachment_12141" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-12141" alt="VIX200sJan3014.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/VIX200sJan3014.png" width="600" height="383" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/VIX200sJan3014-300x191.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/VIX200sJan3014.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/VIX200sJan3014.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">VIX index finally settles down</figcaption></figure> 

Then the 2008 credit crisis hit. Although during the 2008 credit crisis, I was trading for myself and my partners, I still have friends at much more important jobs than I, and over drinks through the years, I have put together a fairly clear picture of the carnage during that period. Whereas during the LTCM crisis the banks were worried about the stability of the system and their clients, they were not the root cause of the problem. However, during the 2008 crisis, the banks and dealers were the ones causing the dislocations through their leveraged positions. So whereas in 1998 at the bank I was working at, we were providing liquidity to our offside hedge fund clients, in 2008 the hedge funds were relatively well positioned and instead of helping out the banks by providing liquidity, they were instead sharks in the water that smelled blood. The stories that I have heard regarding the drying up of liquidity and the subsequent squeeze on protection are mind boggling. I don&#8217;t think the average citizen has any idea how close the system came to collapsing.

In the height of the crisis, investors were willing to pay _anything for insurance._ And pay anything they did. In previous crises, 50% was the high that seemed to be the absolute most investors would pay for equity volatility.

During the 2008 credit crisis, the VIX hit an unbelievable 89.5%!

For those that were long volatility, it was an grand slam home run.<figure id="attachment_12151" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-12151" alt="VIX2008BlwJan3014.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/VIX2008BlwJan3014.png" width="600" height="418" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/VIX2008BlwJan3014-300x209.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/VIX2008BlwJan3014.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/VIX2008BlwJan3014.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">VIX goes vertical during the 2008 crisis!</figcaption></figure> 

And herein lies the problem. The 2008 crisis scared people. Although a lot of younger traders don&#8217;t remember LTCM, and many more don&#8217;t remember 1987, but they all remember 2008.

Since then whenever there is even a hint of a problem, investors whip out the blue buy tickets and load up on equity index volatility. It is made all the worse by the fact that there are a myriad of products out there to enable them. Whether it is VIX futures or VIX Double (and even triple) ETFs, there is a way for investors to get place bets on an increase of volatility.

The trouble is, volatility is a tough difficult beast to be long for a sustained period. Have a look at the performance of the VXX Short Term VIX ETF over the last 5 years (I had to put it on a log scale because the damage has been so extensive $7,500 per share down to $46):<figure id="attachment_12161" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-12161" alt="VXXJan3014.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/VXXJan3014.png" width="600" height="366" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/VXXJan3014-300x183.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/VXXJan3014.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/VXXJan3014.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">VXX ETF &#8211; long way down&#8230;</figcaption></figure> 

With visions of 2008 still in everyone&#8217;s mind, volatility is also consistently over priced. Think about it &#8211; in the past we could assume a 40% or 50% vol under stress. Now models have to be priced to withstand 100%. You need to get compensated for that increased risk.

During this post, I have simplified a lot of concepts and made some generalizations that made it easier for me write. I did not want to get bogged down in option pricing specifics.

**My main point is that after the 2008 crisis, everything changed and too many people are using VIX and other equity volatility as a way to hedge/speculate on a repeat of the expansion of volatility.**

And although I am sympathetic to the fact that equity volatility has quieted down lately and due for a pop, those investors are hedging the last crisis.

This concept of investors&#8217; placing too much emphasis on the current past is as old as the hills. It happens in all assets.

**Therefore back to my hedge fund buddy. If he were to ask me, I would tell him that his long VIX trade was timed nicely, but there are much better assets out there in which to establish long volatility positions.** 

To answer the question about what other assets are better long volatility bets, I like to ask myself, where are the excesses? Where have investors assumed a stable market, but the fundamentals actually reflect a deteriorating situation? Where are the surprises going to be?

For me, there is one market that glaringly stands out as a much better long volatility bet. That market is fixed income.

**Ultimately I think the next crisis does not emanate from equity markets, but instead is the result of the bond market finally throwing up after governments have stuffed it full of everything they could borrow.**

Although there has been a slight downtick in the total amount of Federal Debt as a percentage of GDP, the US is still hovering at insane levels:

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="TotalFedDebtJan3014.png" alt="TotalFedDebtJan3014" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/TotalFedDebtJan3014.png" width="600" height="360" border="0" />

Not only that, but this only represents the Federal Debt. Other debts such as those from the corporate sectors are now increasing very quickly.

The whole system is leveraged to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s zero interest rate policy, and they are very quickly creating an environment where there is no easy way out.

I have already droned on for some time so I don&#8217;t want to wander into all the problems with the Fed&#8217;s policies, but I want you to ask yourself the following: when have investors ever _predicated and hedged for the next crisis?_ By their very nature crises have to be something that no one is expecting.

**So the next time you go and reach for the equity index volality as a hedge, ask yourself what the chances are that the next big crisis looks like the last one.**

**Positions**

**Long various natural gas contracts.** Sold half of my position yesterday morning (and then watched it spike another 10% higher&#8230;  those bullish should thank me for lightening up as that is probably why it rallied so hard). Conviction level: 2

**Short Canadian dollar.**   Covered half of my position yesterday.  Covered all the EURCAD long.  Now just short half a position of CAD vs USD and have a small short CAD vs long JPY.  Conviction 2

**Short S&P 500.    **So far it looks like I didn&#8217;t need to worry about sitting through new highs as late last week the market rolled over pretty hard. Hanging tough and trying to let it cook. Conviction: 4

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

****Long Yen.****  This is a counter trend trade where I am just begging the Market Gods to punish me.  However, I do believe that the Yen is oversold and due for a move higher.  The Americans shot across the bow might very well be the catalyst. **The Yen has started to move my way with the risk off move last week. For now I sit tight.****** **Conviction: 2.  **Stops are last weeks low in Yen terms.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
