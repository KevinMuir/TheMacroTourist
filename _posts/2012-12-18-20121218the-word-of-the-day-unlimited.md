<p class="p1">
  I am bullish on risk assets.&nbsp; Central Bankers throughout the world are stepping on the gas pedal in unison.&nbsp; Yet market participants have decided that it will not work.&nbsp; The entire investing community has decided that monetary policy is completely ineffective and that the authorities are powerless to stop the de-leveraging process. &nbsp;
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Maybe they are right.&nbsp; Maybe it really is different this time. &nbsp;
</p>

<p class="p1">
  However, as I outlined in previous posts, there is a huge difference in the recently announced Quantitative Easing programs.&nbsp; These programs are all different in one important detail &#8211; they are all <strong>UNLIMITED</strong>&nbsp;in their duration.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Central Bankers are increasingly signalling that by hell or high water, they are going to create inflation. &nbsp;
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I have never believed that Central Bankers are incapable of creating inflation.&nbsp; Given the political will, I believe that any Central Bank can engage in reckless enough policies to create inflation.&nbsp; Therefore when I hear a market strategist tell me that the Federal Reserve is <em>powerless</em>&nbsp;to stop the de-leveraging process, I immediately tune out the rest of his analysis.&nbsp; Liquid Ben Bernanke’s famous helicopter speech outlines all the tools in the Central Banker’s arsenal to create inflation.&nbsp; Although I disagree with some of Bernanke’s policies, I do believe he is correct in his analysis that the Federal Reserve is far from powerless when it comes to producing inflation.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  The only real question is whether the Federal Reserve has the stomach to weather the political fall out from these policies.&nbsp; Don’t forget at the Republican primaries, Bernanke’s easy money policies became a hot political issue. &nbsp;
</p>

<p class="p1">
  During the late 1970s Central Banks needed courage to raise rates aggressively to fight off inflation.&nbsp; We are now in the opposite situation.&nbsp; The Federal Reserve is faced with a massive de-leveraging that is overwhelming its monetary easing policies.&nbsp; There is no doubt that we are inching towards a deflationary spiral that if left unchecked would quickly spin out of control.&nbsp; Just as 30 years ago Volcker was faced with taking draconian action to stamp out inflation, Bernanke is now faced with the same sort of dramatic need to stop deflation from taking root.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  However, (and this is the part that the markets are missing), Bernanke has gone <strong>all in</strong>&nbsp;with these two new Quantitative Easing programs. &nbsp; The fact that he has used the word <strong>unlimited</strong>&nbsp;should leave no doubt in your mind.&nbsp; He will print until inflation rears its ugly head. &nbsp;
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Right now, it seems that most Wall Street strategists do not appreciate the enormity of Bernanke’s recent announcements.&nbsp; I read in the Financial Post that famed bear David Rosenberg has continued his call for a moribund market.&nbsp; He does not seem to worry at all about inflation as he says, “interest rates are going nowhere, but long-term interest rates will likely go down.”&nbsp; This morning I listened to Gary Shilling, who has rightly been bullish on bonds for the last 25 years, say that bonds were going to continue to outperform. &nbsp;
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I am surprised at how little strategists like these two fellows are examining the possibility that the Fed might achieve their desire goal of creating inflation.&nbsp; At what point would they become worried about inflation?&nbsp; Would it require the Fed to double this amount of QE?&nbsp; Triple?&nbsp; Surely at some number they would hit a point where they would question the wisdom of assuming that inflation would remain benign.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I am not willing to bet against the Fed.&nbsp; Yes they have been ineffective over the last few years, but the new word of&nbsp;<strong>unlimited</strong>&nbsp;is the key.&nbsp; They will get there, the rubicon of unlimited buying has been crossed.&nbsp; No longer will there be a withdrawal of easing due to the program expiring.&nbsp; This time the program will continue until it works.
</p>

### What does that mean for my market call?

<p class="p1">
  I recently listened to a great interview with Cliff Asness from AQR Capital.&nbsp; Cliff is someone whose opinion I respect greatly.&nbsp; He said something to the effect that stocks were overpriced and were trading in the 80th percentile of expensiveness.&nbsp; However, he went on to explain that bonds were even more overpriced and were trading in the 98th percentile.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Stocks are expensive and I hate to buy expensive assets with the hopes of them getting more expensive, but in this environment, stocks are the least expensive asset out there.&nbsp; The dramatic lowering of real rates has resulted in <em>all assets being overpriced.</em>. &nbsp;
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Which brings me back to an issue of timing for my market call.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I am not a huge long term bull on the stock market.&nbsp; I expect that as real rates inevitably rise, all financial assets will suffer.&nbsp; However in the short term as inflation perks up, the money that has flocked into the supposedly safe bond market will come out, and it will go into equities.&nbsp; There is going to be a massive asset shift in the coming months that will send the bond market tumbling and stocks rising.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  How long that bull market in stocks lasts depends on how ugly the bond market gets.&nbsp; Bill Fleckenstein has a theory that nothing will really get fixed in our economy until the bond market takes away the printing press.&nbsp; I think this theory makes a lot of sense.&nbsp; The politicians will keep spending and putting off the needed reforms, all the while the Central Banks are rapidly expanding the money supply.&nbsp; &nbsp; Eventually this will break down and rates will skyrocket, choking off the economy.&nbsp; At that point government will have to decide to change their trajectory, or simply print more to finance their spending.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  However, that point is way off in the future, and is no use for trading today.
</p>

The important part to realize is that the Fed has changed the rules of the game, yet most participants have not changed their play.&nbsp; Given the relative values of the bond and stock market, a better trade might be to short bonds as opposed to buying equities, but that is a judgement call.&nbsp; Over the short run, they are both going to work.</p>
