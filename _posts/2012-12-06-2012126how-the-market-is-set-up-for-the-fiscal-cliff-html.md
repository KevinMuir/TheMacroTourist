    A month ago I argued that the fiscal cliff worries were being over hyped and that the stock market was due to rally. Consistent with my belief that it is better to be born lucky than smart, I got lucky with that call and the stock market has rallied nicely.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the hope that my lucky streak will continue, I am abandoning that position and actually flipping to the short side.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now, before I continue, let me get one thing straight &#8211; I am cognizant of the fact that there is a lot, no make that an insane amount, of monetary stimulus that has been thrown at this economy and that some day, it will ignite and everything will explode higher. Therefore, if this bearish call proves wrong, I will not be afraid to quickly switch sides again and hop on board.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But, I do not believe that this will happen anytime soon.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How do I come to his conclusion? To understand that, let&#8217;s first try to determine what outcome to this fiscal cliff mess is &#8220;built into&#8221; the market.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As I mentioned, a month ago there was a lot of pessimism surrounding the ability of politicians to come to an agreement about the fiscal cliff. Since then the President has paraded a bunch of business leaders through the White House, the GOP and DEMs leaders have met and held rosy joint press conferences, and in general, most political and financial pundits are acknowledging that the problem is so severe that there is no way the politicians won&#8217;t put aside their hard lines to come to an agreement.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In fact, I have heard the famous Winston Churchill line about Americans doing the right thing so often, <strong>that I refuse to reprint it here.</strong> This concept that at the end of the day a deal will get done because it &#8220;has to&#8221; is now fully <strong><em>consensus opinion.</em></strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Instead of embracing what has now become a terrible sound bite on financial TV, I would prefer to use another quote from Winston Churchill. I think the following Churchillian nugget of wisdom is much more appropriate:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Want of foresight, unwillingness to act when action would be simple and effective, lack of clear thinking, confusion of counsel until the emergency comes, until self-preservation strikes its jarring gong these are the features which constitute the endless repetition of history.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    I believe that the market <strong>is staying strong because they think the politicians will do the right thing.</strong> However, the politicians are looking at the market and saying, &#8220;the stock market is indicating this cliff is no big deal therefore there is no need to compromise&#8221;. It is similar to Soros&#8217; reflexivity theory where the ultimate price of the asset is affected by the price action of the asset. It is a closed loop with neither side realizing that they are looking at a mirror.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Just like Churchill has warned, there is a good chance that this fiscal cliff problem will not get resolved until the emergency comes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I very well might be wrong. The politicians might surprise me and pull a rabbit out their hat as a Christmas present for the market.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, I think that even if they do, the risk reward still favours the downside.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As the market has rallied over the last month, it has increasingly priced in a successful resolution to the fiscal cliff crisis. A deal announcement would cause a pop in the market, but it won&#8217;t be nearly as long lasting as the bulls would hope. Most bulls are already invested, and most bears are too scared to short. Without some new buyers, it will be difficult to sustain higher prices. Don&#8217;t forget that the announcement of QE3 coincided with the stock market high almost to the hour. From there, it grinded lower for the next month. If we were to get a deal, it would be a very similar situation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And in the mean time, as every day ticks by without progress, the longs will get increasingly nervous that they have once again assumed too much intelligence from the politicians and the selling very well might intensify.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In previous posts I have spoken about the reasons why I think a deal has become increasingly less likely. However, regardless of the outcome, given the market&#8217;s positioning, I think the right &#8220;trade&#8221; is to err on the side of fading all those new found Churchill quote loving investors.
