I have [I have](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2013/3/1/sxrjwk5dvb3htg7nqrswj2qv46c1v4) about how over the last couple of years I have mistakenly assumed that the beginning of the year strength in the economy and financial markets would achieve escape velocity and become a full self-reinforcing recovery.

This year I have been aware of this tendency to be overly optimistic and I have luckily side stepped the rally in US Treasury bonds on the back of the recent disappointing economic data.

Here is the chart of the US 10 Year Treasury yield over the last 4 years:

You will notice that each year the March period proved to be the high in yields for the year.

I am not saying that this will happen again.  One of these days the economy will achieve escape velocity and the bond market will never look back.  However, everyone is aware of the Einstein&#8217;s famous definition of insanity.  I would be foolish to assume for some reason, even though the economic data is rolling over, that this year would be different.  I am going to wait and err on not trading bonds from the short side until there is a fundamental reason to do so.  In other words, I am going to make the economy prove to me that the recovery is becoming self reinforcing.

And as for the stock market, it is a very similar looking chart:

The only observation that I would add is that the bond market seems to &#8216;figure it out&#8217; earlier.  Over the last four years yields topped in March, while the stock market seemed to take another month to roll over.  As usual, the bond traders seem to be a little smarter than the always overly optimistic stock traders.

I am already worried about the financial markets and this sort of pattern is not making me any less pessimistic.
