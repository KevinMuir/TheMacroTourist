I am short the stock market, and there is no doubt that it is beginning to hurt, but I am hanging tough for a few more days at least.

A lot of people are focusing on the fact that today is a Fed Day and that on average, these days are bullish for the stock market. According to Bespoke, the stock market return for Fed meeting days has been 0.54% since 2008. At first blush this does indeed seem to support the general consensus that you should be trading today from the long side. 

However, the great website Quantifiable Edges did a terrific study where he showed that when the S&P closes at a new 20 day high before the Fed meeting, the next day&#8217;s results are average at best. 

Given the fact that the S&P closes at an _all time high_ yesterday, I would definitely say this counts:

The Fed days where the market is a little worried about the results seem to produce better returns than the days where the market is pushing up into new highs. So I am going to ignore the general hype regarding Fed days causing the market to rally because the numbers seem to support that this is not the case this time.

In addition, the fact that there is no POMO today, and that tomorrow&#8217;s POMO is scheduled to be under a billion dollars, leads me to be a little less concerned about my shorts over the short run.

And finally, last month I made myself a reminder about a great little note that Bespoke wrote about the recent trend for month ends to be negative. I am going to post their stats as it is far from proprietary, but it is enlightening to see the consistency that month ends finish in the red:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/BespokeLastDayOct3013.jpg" alt="BespokeLastDayOct3013" title="BespokeLastDayOct3013.jpg" border="0" width="290" height="492" />

You can see that the first column, which is the result of the last day of the month, is much more negative than the second column, which is the return on the first day of the month.

As I mentioned earlier, I am short and wrong, and even though it feels like the stock market won&#8217;t stop rising, I am going to grin and bear the pain for now.

With the index screaming to new highs, it is uncomfortable to say the least, but I don&#8217;t think today is a good place to reduce any risk. If I do bring some in (which I haven&#8217;t decided yet), I will do so into tomorrow&#8217;s close.
