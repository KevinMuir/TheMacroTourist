I am not sure why, but I don&#8217;t trust this rally in the stock market. I have been lucky enough to be long the US market, but we are up almost 75 handles from the lows of last week.

I am going to start peeling some stock exposure off into strength. 

I worry that all the good news might be &#8220;baked in&#8221;.
