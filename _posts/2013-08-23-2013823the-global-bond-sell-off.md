Last year I was really negative on bonds.  Whenever I told someone my view, they would inevitably tell me how there was no inflation anywhere and therefore being bearish on bonds was not the right call.  I remember telling them that inflation didn&#8217;t necessarily need to increase to have a bond bear market.  The usual reaction was to shake their head and stop talking to the guy who obviously didn&#8217;t have a clue how markets work.

Fast forward to today.  We have experienced a world wide bond bear market of epic proportions, yet inflation is still relatively well behaved.  These same people who thought you couldn&#8217;t have a bond bear market without inflation now explain to me that it all has to do with the Fed tapering and that it was obvious that real rates had to rise when the Fed stopped buying.

I don&#8217;t want to rehash why I think the Fed tapering argument is crap &#8211; I am convinced it is only one small part in the host of reasons why bonds are backing up so quickly.

Instead what I want to do is run through some charts and show you the very real increase in global rates.

First US 10 Year yields:

Across the board we have experienced a massive increase in rates.  This is a pretty amazing response to the mere suggestion that the Fed might taper their bond buying (my Mother always said that sarcasm was the sign of an unoriginal mind).

These same experts who previously claimed bonds would never go down without inflation are now predicting that the tapering will cause further rise in yields.

I am obviously not as smart as these experts and cannot claim with the same sort of conviction that rates will not keep increasing.

However I would like to suggest the following: these rate rises are real and very large.  In this era of massive indebtedness, this will have a inordinate effect on the global economy.  Markets and economies will not be able to withstand these sorts of rises indefinitely.

The only way we are going to dig our way out of this economic morass is to have real rates stay negative for an extended period of time.  So either inflation has to go up, or rates have to go back down.  Right now, we have neither.  That is unsustainable.
