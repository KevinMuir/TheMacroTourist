There are conversations that only in hindsight you realize how important they were as clues to what was about to unfold in the financial markets.  I distinctly remember one such conversation that I had in 2007.  I was playing squash with a Private Equity guy (I know, I know, how very Thurston Howell of me) and after our game we got to talking shop.  At one point he said something to the effect that he was amazed at the loans he was able to receive.  I think his exact words were something to the effect; &#8216;I have heard of covenant light loans, but these are **covenant free loans!**&#8216;  Unfortunately I did not have the mental sharpness to truly comprehend what he was telling me.  It was only once the credit markets crashed that I realized how ridiculous these lenders had been.  It was a huge wake up call for me to watch for these kind of anecdotal clues that are often sitting right there in front of you in plain sight.

Since then I have been on the lookout for imprudent lending.  Given the massively negative real rates I am very confident that it will occur (or already has) &#8211; I am just not sure where.  I have my theories, but there is no glaring obvious bubble.  But then again, it is always only in hindsight that the bubbles are obvious.  Although I was bearish on housing in the mid 2000s, I was early, and most importantly, never in a million years did I think it would be as bad as it was.

Nevertheless, I do believe there is a very good chance that we are currently in some sort of credit bubble.  I am not sure where it is, but real rates have been negative for way too long and that a misallocation of credit will undoubtedly be the result.

In some ways I believe that this credit cycle will be even worse than the previous one as that one was fuelled by institutional lending, whereas this one has been much more the result of individuals chasing yield.  The banks got hammered 5 years ago, this time it will be all the income chasing Baby Boomers.

Don&#8217;t believe that fixed income is being chased?  Have a look at this chart:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/f01e186a7829072409e8684b32443fab.png" />

We are in uncharted territory here.  Junk bonds are massively expensive versus stocks.

But wait, maybe stocks are just cheap.

Nope, fixed income yields are sitting near all time lows:

Companies can borrow at levels that we have not seen for decades.  And companies are taking advantage of this:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/dd557a0eb22f433ff6bfa96e862f090a.png" />

The non-financial sector of our economy has been extremely busy locking in funding and taking down credit.

However, the real scary part of this whole process is the fact that investors are increasingly returning to the crazy days of the mid 2000s and forsaking convenants:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/511cdd85e4b00307a2628d7c/1360846214988/%E2%80%8Ewww.brandywineglobal.com_usa_pdf_193985391.pdf-1.jpg.com_usa_pdf_193985391.pdf-1.jpg?format=original" />

I would have thought that we would have learned our lesson and that reckless lending would have gone the way of the dodo bird (or at least taken longer than 5 years to reappear).  However, once again I would have thought wrong.

It is clear to me that we are in the midst of making a real mess again.  Wise sages like Dan Sales from Loomis are warning about fixed income:

> Dan Fuss, whose Loomis Sayles Bond Fund beat 98 percent of its peers in the last three years, said the fixed-income market is more “overbought” than at any time in his 55-year career

Another &#8216;decent&#8217; investor by the name of George Soros is also concerned:

> There will be a dramatic rise in interest rates as soon as there are clear signs the U.S. economy is picking up, billionaire financier George Soros told CNBC.

> Soros said that the U.S. needs to reestablish growth to help shrink its debt pile and that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy of buying U.S. debt, is the right one since it doesn&#8217;t add to the net amount of debt outstanding. &#8220;It&#8217;s about as close to a free lunch as you can get,&#8221; he said.

> But there is a risk, Soros warned, &#8220;Once the economy gets going, then interest rates are going to take a big leap.&#8221;

The best trade in 2007 was to short credit and go long sovereigns.  Although history does often rhyme, it very seldom repeats, and certainly not so quickly.  So even though this looks very similar to the previous credit bubble, I think the odds don&#8217;t favour a similar experience.

My guess is that the entire bond market, including sovereigns, will get crushed this time when the bubble bursts.

Remember the fact that the Fed is spear heading this desperate attempt to encourage borrowing.

Just this morning, Ben Bernanke is defending his QE programs in front of Congress:

> &#8220;In the current economic environment, the benefits of asset purchases&#8230;are clear,&#8221;

<p class="p1">
  <p>
    And just in case you are thinking that Bernanke&#8217;s soothing words mean there is nothing to worry about, remember back to July 2005:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      INTERVIEWER: Ben, there&#8217;s been a lot of talk about a housing bubble, particularly, you know [inaudible] from all sorts of places. Can you give us your view as to whether or not there is a housing bubble out there?
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      BERNANKE: Well, unquestionably, housing prices are up quite a bit; I think it&#8217;s important to note that fundamentals are also very strong. We&#8217;ve got a growing economy, jobs, incomes. We&#8217;ve got very low mortgage rates. We&#8217;ve got demographics supporting housing growth. We&#8217;ve got restricted supply in some places. So it&#8217;s certainly understandable that prices would go up some. I don&#8217;t know whether prices are exactly where they should be, but I think it&#8217;s fair to say that much of what&#8217;s happened is supported by the strength of the economy.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      INTERVIEWER: Tell me, what is the worst-case scenario? Sir, we have so many economists coming on our air and saying, &#8220;Oh, this is a bubble, and it&#8217;s going to burst, and this is going to be a real issue for the economy.&#8221; Some say it could even cause a recession at some point. What is the worst-case scenario, if in fact we were to see prices come down substantially across the country?
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      BERNANKE: Well, I guess I don&#8217;t buy your premise. It&#8217;s a pretty unlikely possibility. We&#8217;ve never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis. So what I think is more likely is that house prices will slow, maybe stabilize: might slow consumption spending a bit. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to drive the economy too far from its full employment path, though.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    I don&#8217;t think he could have gotten that one more wrong.  Obviously he did not understand the risks he was taking with the easy monetary policy of the early 2000s.  And it is not just Bernanke that seems to be incapable of foreseeing potential problems, but the most likely next Fed Chairperson Janet Yellen, also seems just as clueless:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “It’s fitting for Chairman Greenspan to leave office with the economy in such solid shape. The situation you&#8217;re handling off to your successor is a lot like a tennis racquet with a gigantic sweet spot” &#8211; Yellen wishing farewell to Greenspan at his last meeting in a 2006 FOMC transcript.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    It is therefore with a great deal of angst that I report the following Bernanke quote:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      January 14, 2013. “I don’t believe significant inflation is going to be the result” of the central bank’s quantitative easing measures.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    I am not able to tell you how this going to all play out.  The only thing I am confident of is that Bernanke & Co. have just as little ability to help with this forecast as I do.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I also am worried that we are in the midst of another equally obvious credit bubble but that I am once again, too limited to really fully comprehend it.
