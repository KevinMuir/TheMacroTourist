Last night the new Bank of Japan Governor unleashed a massive Quantitative Easing program that has put a monster bid under the Japanese stock market.  It has also caused the US market to pull out of its recent nose dive.

Although it certainly seems like all is right in the world again, I am not quite so sanguine.  I am concerned that the recent volatility is a sign of a topping process.  I am also disturbed by the fact that many traditional relationships have completely broken down.  I have highlighted the recent breakdown in the correlation between the S&P 500 and US 30 Year Treasury yields.  This morning this divergence has widened even more.

The S&P is resuming its advance on the back of the NIkkei strength, yet the 30 year US treasury yield is falling.

I believe that we are entering into a new period where markets are disconnected from fundamentals all the more as the amount of Central Bank intervention has never been higher.  Investors are confused and don&#8217;t know how to react.

The potential for large moves in either direction is quite high, but given the stretched nature of the market, I am much more concerned about the potential for a flash crash than anything else.

My spidey senses are tingling and I think that continuing to whittle down positions is the right way to go.
