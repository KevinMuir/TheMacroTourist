The MacroTourist has once again left his Christmas shopping too late, so I am taking the rest of the week off.

I would like to take a moment to thank everyone who takes the time to read my letter throughout the year, and for those kind enough to share their thoughts and research pieces with me.  It is my privilege to have such a great group of readers.

I can't help but leave you with something to try to put a smile on your face.  Being a Canadian, I obviously grew up around hockey.  Yet over the years coaching my kids soccer, I have learned to appreciate the world's most popular sport.  I have even gotten to the point where Saturday morning I enjoy turning on the Premier League and watching a little soccer (sorry, football).  Yet even though I have embraced the game, I am still perplexed at all the writhing on the ground at the slightest contact.  

But I have recently discovered there is a problem with leadership.  And to fix it, we need to start at the top.  I am creating a petition to swap soccer coaches with hockey coaches for a couple of weeks.  That way, we won't get anymore shit like this...  [Soccer coach gets paper airplane in head vs. hockey coach getting puck in face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxTDo9zH9yA).  Either that or we get those Aussie coaches to take a turn - those guys are stupid tough.

Have a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and a wonderful New Year.

The MacroTourist is back on January 10th, 2017.

Thanks for everything,
