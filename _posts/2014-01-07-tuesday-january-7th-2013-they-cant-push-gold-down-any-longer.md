**They can&#8217;t push gold down any longer**

I have never given much credence to the gold bugs who claim that the world&#8217;s Central Banks are colluding to keep the price of gold down. Although I do not put it past governments to attempt to manipulate the price of gold, to claim that the whole move down from $1900 to $1200 was the result of nefarious Central Bankers intent on sinking the the price of gold is simply naive. Central Bankers have much bigger and more important financial asset prices to fix. Gold is simply too small a market with very little upside for them to waste time manipulating the prices downward.

I find it amusing how the tin foil hat gold bugs scream manipulation the moment someone puts in an order to sell 1,000&#8217;s of gold contracts in a &#8220;sloppy way&#8221;. 

I do not dispute for a moment that over the last couple of years this sort of pushing the price downward aggressively has happened an inordinate amount of times. There has definitely been a series of &#8220;raids&#8221; that have often occurred in the illiquid morning hours which has push gold downward in a sickening swoosh. 

The Eric Sprott&#8217;s and Michael Pento&#8217;s of the world will blame this aggressive selling on the Central Banks. These conspiracy theorists view the selling as inexplicably aggressive therefore it must be a non-economic actor selling for ulterior reasons. 

However, I think they are missing the most obvious explanation. 

Although they moan about how it is stupid for anyone to sell so aggressively at illiquid times in the trading day, I would ask them to have a look at the P&L for all of these sales that have occurred over the last two years. As stupid as those sales seem in the moment, they are all now well onside. The price of gold has been steadily marching lower:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/GOLDLTJan0713.gif" alt="GOLDLTJan0713" title="GOLDLTJan0713.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

The simple truth of the matter is that **the gold bugs simply got over their skis too far, and that the price has been going down because there were too many weak longs.** The 10 year bull market had pushed a lot of momentum chasers into the market, and the price was due for a correction.

The aggressive illiquid selling &#8220;raids&#8221; were most likely not some evil Central Banker, but more likely a cunning hedge fund (or group of hedge funds) realizing that the longs were offside and vulnerable. These &#8220;raids&#8221; were successful in that it accelerated the move to the downside. 

My suspicion is that there is a rather large short position that has &#8220;helped along&#8221; their position with these midnight moves.

This is confirmed with the massive explosion in short interest:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/GOLDShortJan0713.gif" alt="GOLDShortJan0713" title="GOLDShortJan0713.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

Hedge funds are like wolves that prey on the weak and sick. Gold speculators simply represented the most exposed large macro trade and over the last year hedge funds have ruthlessly pushed the price of gold lower as they have profited from gold bugs&#8217; weak position. But make no mistake about it &#8211; if the market was truly healthy, then these hedge funds would have been met with stiff resistance. The only reason they were able to &#8220;manipulate&#8221; the price lower was that the market was filled with weak longs.

However, over the last month the character of the trading in gold has changed. Yesterday was a perfect example of this change. In a usual attempt to push the price lower and shake out the weak longs, someone sold a few thousand gold contracts at the market. Gold immediately puked $30:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/GOLDgipJAN0714.gif" alt="GOLDgipJAN0714" title="GOLDgipJAN0714.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

But it was different this time &#8211; the price did not continue going lower. **No, instead this time the selling was met with strong buying and the price immediately returned to approximately the previous level.** This leads me to conclude that the gold bears are no longer able to push the price lower. 

How a market reacts to these sorts of moves tells a lot about the health of the market. Last year, the market was sick and did not react well. This year is a completely different story.

I have a lot of other reasons for wanting to own gold, but the fact that they can no longer push it down is probably the best reason of them all.

**Things that I am watching**

**Canadian dollar**

Although I have no position yet, I am watching the Canadian dollar closely. 

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/CADJan0714.gif" alt="CADJan0714" title="CADJan0714.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

The CAD has been steadily getting weaker (higher USDCAD rate) and if it wasn&#8217;t for my belief that the whole &#8220;commodity trade&#8221; is over sold and due for a bounce, then I would probably be short. I hate to chase markets, but I think if the USDCAD breaks out to new highs, then I will most likely climb aboard. 

Although I am not a roaring Alaskan grizzly in regards to the Canadian economy, I think it is going to be tough sledding for a while. We have had a lot of big tailwinds at our back, but those good times are now firmly in the rearview mirror. At the margin, Canada&#8217;s economy is going to under perform the US or Mexico&#8217;s economy. This should keep rates lower for longer in Canada. We simply cannot compete with a 1.06 loonie and the CAD will probably continue to grind lower in the coming years.

**Fed fund futures**
  

  
The Fed&#8217;s attempt to taper and replace their stimulus with forward rate guidance continues to underwhelm market participants. I am watching the December 2015 Federal Funds futures contract closely:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/FFZ5Jan0713.gif" alt="FFZ5Jan0713" title="FFZ5Jan0713.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

After the taper announcement there was a slight uptick as the forward rate news was digested, but it has been straight down since then. This contract is signalling an almost 75 basis point Fed Funds rate by the end of 2015, something the Fed is definitely not signalling. The Fed&#8217;s message that the &#8220;taper is not tightening&#8221; does not seem to be sinking in.

**Positions**

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long various natural gas contracts.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather and I am tempted to lighten up. Conviction level: 4. No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long US treasury 5-30 year steepener and the 2-30 year steepener.** Conviction level: 3. I used to like this position a lot, but the action in the curve after the taper has got me worried. For now I am going to use 215 basis points on the 5-30 as my stop.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** Not the greatest trade so far, but I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. I have no long hedge on versus this position, but I am thinking about reinstating one into the recent weakness in the S&P 500. Conviction level: 3. No stop for now.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** I am long bond market volatility as I think the next crisis will start in the bond market. Conviction level: 3. 

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 6

I have more tag positions, but I am not going to bother with all the smaller little trades. This represents most of my big bets.
