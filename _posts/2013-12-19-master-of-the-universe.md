I have to admit to a little bit of a morbid fascination with Carl Icahn. Ever since he went on CNBC and got in an [embarrassing pissing match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCZRk1lL90Q) with the equally arrogant hedge fund &#8220;titan&#8221; Bill Ackman, I have been perplexed at how someone so petty can be considered one of the &#8220;world&#8217;s greatest investors.&#8221; You don&#8217;t see George Soros, Warren Buffett or even the notoriously prickly Michael Steinhardt fighting their battles on national TV. These men are simply too smart to engage in that sort of behaviour, so I am confused to why Carl Icahn is put in the same league.

I have been even more fascinated by the recent success Carl has had with some of his positions. The cult like following Carl has developed would make the Sciencetologists jealous. What is most unbelievable is his ability to move mega cap stocks like Apple with his simple tweeting of his positions. I understand when Carl&#8217;s tweets move up some mid tier equity, but to move Apple, one of the largest stocks in the world, up significantly is quite a feat.

Given his behaviour on National TV, instead of putting him the camp of one of the world&#8217;s greatest investors, I am much more inclined to put him in the camp as one of the world&#8217;s most aggressive big investors. Therefore, his tremendous recent success is much more the result of riding the Fed induced financial asset reflation bubble than anything else. Carl has correctly identified the massive subsidy that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s QE policies have showered on equity owners and exploited it to the fullest.

In short, Carl is the poster child of why the Fed&#8217;s policies have failed so miserably. The main beneficiaries of the Fed&#8217;s massively easy policies have been the Carl Icahn&#8217;s of the world instead of the average worker.

I have a theory that we are hitting a tipping point of maximum inequality. It is not based on anything more than society&#8217;s increasing awareness that the recent policies of reflating asset bubbles is doing nothing more than enriching the rich, all the while the middle class is slowly disappearing and the poor are increasingly marginalized. This whole idea of the trickle down wealth effect is becoming increasingly discredited.

Therefore I think we have hit a point where the Carl Icahn&#8217;s of the world find themselves on the wrong side of the trade. Going forward, I am not willing to bet that the rich will get richer, and the poor will get poorer. 

I am not yet sure how it is going to come to be, but I just get the feeling that this winter&#8217;s swoon in the stock market will mark the highs in societal inequality. 

This recent TIME magazine cover has only made me more certain that Carl&#8217;s fortunes have peaked:

&#8220;Master of the Universe?&#8221; The market gods do not take kindly to this kind of adulation. 

What is the saying, &#8220;foolish faces appear in foolish places?&#8221;

The fact that Carl allowed himself to be put on the cover with that sort of headline does not surprise me one bit. However, this marks the beginning of the end. My suspicion is that it is only downhill from here. And given that Carl is mostly long US equities, I feel that this is yet another sign of the tenuous nature of the stretched equity market.

On the Bloomberg we have created a portfolio of all of Carl&#8217;s publicly reported holdings:

You will notice that it&#8217;s value has already peaked (approximately at the same time the magazine hit the new stand?). But don&#8217;t worry &#8211; Carl is the Master of the Universe and the Fed has got his back &#8211; nothing can go wrong&#8230;
