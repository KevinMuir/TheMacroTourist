We are now into our third Quantitative Easing program. The Federal Reserve is buying $85 billion of assets every month. The Fed&#8217;s balance sheet has never been larger. 

Given this situation, surely you would think that real interest rates would be as low as they have ever been. 

Well, much to the Fed&#8217;s chagrin, real interest rates across the curve have been rising and the Fed seems powerless to stop it.

Let&#8217;s start with a chart of the short end of the curve, where the Fed has the most control:

This is the 2 year real rate (2 year treasury yield minus CPI inflation), which gives you the after inflation return that an investor would expect. You can see that the Fed does indeed have this rate at a negative level, indicating that their policy is causing financial repression. Although the rate is negative, it has been rising and is up a long way from the lows of 2011.

When you head out the curve, you will notice that the Federal Reserve is less able to influence those rates, and that at a 10 year term, the real rate is now firmly positive:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/REAL10Nov1413.gif" alt="REAL10Nov1413" title="REAL10Nov1413.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

What is most alarming about this chart is the fact that this 10 year real rate has been steadily moving from minus 200 basis points to positive 150 basis points over the last couple of years. Even though the Fed is buying more and more of the Treasury market, they cannot stop the real rate from rising.

I have long argued that the Fed&#8217;s QE buying is far from bond positive and that if they are successful in their endeavour, it will actually cause inflation, which will cause the bond market to fall. 

The worrying aspect of this rise in real rates is that it is not being caused by an uptick in rates due to a growth spurt, but instead is being caused by inflation falling precipitously all the while interest rates are chugging higher. In a regular economy this would not be something to worry about &#8211; at this stage we would already be in the self reinforcing part of the economic cycle. 

However, this is far from a regular economy.

We are still heavily indebted and the natural state absent monetary stimulus is for credit to be paid down. The Federal Reserve needs to keep rates at negative levels otherwise we will return to our deflationary feedback loop.

As for trade ideas, I don&#8217;t really have any. But I did notice that the lows in the real rates coincided with the highs in gold. Here is the chart of the US 10 year real rate versus an inverted gold price:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/GLDRealRateNov1413.gif" alt="GLDRealRateNov1413" title="GLDRealRateNov1413.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

In hindsight, this makes perfect sense and explains the recent gold weakness. A lot of people think gold trades with inflation. Gold is actually much more correlated with real rates. During the late 1970s and early 1980s when gold was exploding higher, inflation was indeed skyrocketing. For a long while, interest rates did not rise as quickly as gold, and therefore real rates were dramatically negative. However when Volcker stepped in and raised rates, the gold market quickly responded and that was the end of the bull market.

I am not sure what is going to happen to real rates this time. My gut tells me that given our hugely over indebted economy, there is no way we can afford to have real rates at such a positive level for long. Everyone thinks that the Fed controls interest rates, but the long end is only influenced by the Fed &#8211; they do not set it (yet). 

This rise in real rates is a bigger deal than most market observers realize, and it very well could be sowing the seeds for the next big crisis.
