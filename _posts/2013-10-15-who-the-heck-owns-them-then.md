I just caught a glimpse of a headline that Citigroup does not own any Treasuries maturing prior to November 1st. 

Last week Blackrock announced the following:

> *BLACKROCK SAYS \`ZERO EXPOSURE&#8217; TO DEBT MATURING IN LATE OCT.
> 
> *BLACKROCK SAYS NO HOLDINGS IN TREASURIES MATURING IN EARLY NOV. 

And Zero Hedge had previously reported that Fidelity had also cut exposure:

> The nation&#8217;s largest manager of money market mutual funds said Wednesday that it no longer holds any U.S. government debt that comes due around the time the nation could hit its borrowing limit.
> 
> Portfolio managers at Fidelity Investments have been selling off their government debt holdings over the last couple of weeks, said Nancy Prior, president of Fidelity&#8217;s Money Market Group. While Fidelity expects the debt ceiling issue to be resolved, the Boston-based asset manager said it is taking steps to protect investors.
> 
> Prior said that Fidelity no longer holds any U.S. debt that comes due in late October or early November, the window considered by many investors to be the most exposed if the government runs out of money and defaults on its obligations. 

And even the Government&#8217;s favourite banker JP Morgan has sold the hot potato t-bill issue:

> J.P. Morgan takes action in light of possible U.S. Government default
> 
> Although J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc (JPMIM) continues to believe that the probability of a U.S. Government default is low, it has taken certain precautionary measures with respect to the money markets (the “Funds”)
> 
> These actions were taken in an attempt to manage the Funds in line with their objectives to seek to maintain a net asset value of $1.00 per share.
> 
> · As of October 9, 2013, the funds did not own any securities issued by the U.S. Treasury that mature or have scheduled coupon payments between October 16, 2013 and November 6, 2013.
> 
> · In addition, JPMIM has increased liquidity positions in the Funds

What I want to know is who the heck owns them then?

Although I think I already know the answer…
