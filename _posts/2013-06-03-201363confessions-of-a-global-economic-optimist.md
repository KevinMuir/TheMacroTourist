My name is Kevin and I have a problem.  I have spoken about this problem [before](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2013/3/1/sxrjwk5dvb3htg7nqrswj2qv46c1v4), but I am in the midst of abusing again.

You see, I am an optimist who believes that the massive amounts of monetary stimulus that has been applied to the global economy will eventually lead to an self reinforcing global economic upturn.

Over the past few years I have suffered heavy withdrawal symptoms as the start of every year seems to be filled with much hope and optimism, but then something manages to mess it up which sends the world economy back into its de-levering contractionary cycle.

This year was no different and we had the obligatory spring high for economic expectations:

I was fortunate enough to get clean during this period and not push my luck in terms of staying long pro-growth positions.

However, over the last month I have once again become a heavy user with massive short positions in fixed income, long commodities and long other &#8216;risk on&#8217; assets.

I am having real trouble assuming that the massive balance sheet expansion by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, and a host of other irresponsible Central Banks is not going to create a global economic upturn.  Yes, I think it will ultimately be a disaster that rivals all the greatest bubble poppings, but in the mean time, I believe it will kick start a self reinforcing economic upturn.

Once it becomes self reinforcing, it will get out of hand very quickly as the monetary base has become irresponsibly bloated.  Central Banks always over shoot and this time will prove no different.  The only difference will be that the sheer size of the stimulus that has been applied to the various world economies over the last 5 years will make the overshoot all the more explosive.

Yet I am scared that this is the addiction talking again&#8230;  I am scared that the global de-levering is so over whelming that the moment the market senses that the stimulus is being withdrawn even a little bit, the de-levering process will once again engulf the economy.

However, I really think this time we are going to break free.  The pessimism regarding the economy is about as high as I have ever seen it.  No one thinks that an economic upturn can become self sustaining.  This is the kind of attitude that often marks long term bottoms.

Please don&#8217;t send me back to rehab, this time it is going to work&#8230;  I just know it&#8230;
