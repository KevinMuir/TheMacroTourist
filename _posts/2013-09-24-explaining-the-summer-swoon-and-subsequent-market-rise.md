During the last couple of weeks, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s actions and the Administration&#8217;s fumbling of the decision of determining Ben Bernanke&#8217;s successor have had an outsized effect on the markets. 

The market&#8217;s summer swoon was no doubt in part the discounting of the Syria situation, but it also reflected the building into the price of two relatively hawkish developments. The Administration signalled that Larry Summers was the leading contender to replace Ben Bernanke. The market had not assigned a high probability of Summers securing the position, so when it appeared that the White House was serious in making Summers their choice, the market was forced to assign a greater likelihood that the monetary stimulus would be withdrawn sooner than if Summers was not the next Fed Chairman. This unexpected choice from the White House was already influencing stimulus expectations, but it was made worse through the market&#8217;s perceived belief of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s assessment that the economy had reached a level where the QE would start to be gradually withdrawn. Therefore during the summer months, we had a market that was bracing for a tighter monetary policy. Combined with the Syria situation it was understandable that the summer months were soft.

Then a few things started to line up for the bulls. Firstly the Syria situation, which had seemed destined to only get worse before it got better, suddenly took an unexpected turn and before you knew it, the threat of war was at least temporarily off the table. Then, faced with a growing backlash against their choice of Fed Chairman, the White House gave the bulls another unexpected break with Summers withdrawing himself from the running. And finally, even though a $10 to $15 billion taper was fully priced into the market, the Federal Reserve chose to surprise the markets and not taper at the September meeting.

All of these developments caused a virtual feeding frenzy in risk assets. Stocks in particular seem to have captured the public and professionals&#8217; attention. Investors who had previously shunned stocks for the safety of bonds suddenly found themselves chasing equities into new highs.

However, the really interesting action has all occurred since the Federal Reserve meeting. Although Bernanke held tough with the party line during the press conference, some of the other Fed Governor&#8217;s have chosen to abandon the tough talk and have thrown Bernanke under the bus.

I believe that the Federal Reserve did in fact screw up big time when they chose to not taper this meeting. **The market had fully priced in a modest taper,** it was a no brainer to simply give them what they wanted. By not tapering, the Federal Reserve has chosen to alter market expectations and reset monetary stimulus expectations. This will make the eventual withdrawal all the more difficult. Markets will now be even more confused about when and how the tapering will occur. Although I am always sympathetic to the idea that we have _too much transparency_ from the Federal Reserve, absent a change in this policy, the Federal Reserve should think very hard about the consequences of not following through with market expectations. Don&#8217;t forget that these expectations are set from communications from the Federal Reserve. Fisher is bang on correct when he says that this decision &#8220;undermines Fed credibility&#8221;. 

However, let&#8217;s put aside the opinions about what should have been done and talk about what really matters &#8211; how the markets will react to this. 

There seems to be universal agreement that there is only one trade to do &#8211; buy risk assets. I am shocked at how widespread this attitude is. I expect this sort of mindless BTFD attitude from most CNBC types, but there are really smart guys like Stanley Druckenmiller who explain that although they hate the policy, they realize that stocks are the only game in town and you have to be long.

I must not be as smart as all of these guys who &#8216;get it&#8217;, but I am still at a loss of why they believe that the Federal Reserve is able to engineer economic growth with their aggressive monetary expansion. I am not as convinced that the Federal Reserve really understands the consequences of their actions. And although I do acknowledge that stocks do indeed seem to be the only place left to hide, I am reminded that this same argument was used for fix income only a year ago. 

This last month has been a perfect storm of good news for the stock market. Although it seems like this perfect storm is never going to end, I am old enough to know that it always does and it often happens just when no one expects itâ€¦
