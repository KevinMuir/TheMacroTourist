[I first posted a note](http://gfbcompanies.squarespace.com/the-macro-tourist/2012/11/20/petrobank-my-new-favourite-trade.html) about this position at the end of November when PBG was trading $12.40 and the PBG/PBN stub was roughly $0.10.

[I posted again](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2012/12/27/pbg-pbn-update) at the end of December, suggesting that you should increase the position.

Since then, the reorg has been completed and the position has moved in my favour.

Last week I started to unwind the position, selling my long PBG in the $1.20 area while pitching the PBN in the $10.60 range.

If you held the PBG outright before the spin out, the sales of the two pieces would result in selling the &#8216;old&#8217; PBG at approximately $12.91.

If instead you had invested in the fully hedged PBG/PBN spread, selling the PBG at $1.20 is a big win from the $0.10-$0.50 range that you could have bought it at last month.

I believe that both pieces are still heading higher, but the high probability part of the trade is complete.
