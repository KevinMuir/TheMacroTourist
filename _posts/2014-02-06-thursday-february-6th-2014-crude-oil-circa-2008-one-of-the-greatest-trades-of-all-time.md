Do you remember the period after the 2008 credit crisis when global trade evaporated overnight, and in the process, the price of crude oil plummeted from a summer price of over $140 to a year end low of under $35? It is easy to forget as there was so much destruction in the equity and credit markets that many seem to forget the truly horrific crash that crude oil also suffered.<figure id="attachment_13241" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

What I remember best about this period was the fact that although spot crude oil was trading at a price that signified a 75% decline, the deferred month futures refused to descend downward to the same degree. Therefore the commodity curve was exceptionally steep. It thus made sense for market participants to store oil, sell the forward futures short and deliver into expiry. The yields that could be achieved were astounding. I can&#8217;t remember the specifics, but I know the returns weren&#8217;t overnights plus 100 basis points. It was more like 50% or 100% leveraged annualized returns.

Very quickly, all available storage was filled and sold forward. Then the lack of empty storage only made the steepness all the worse.

**And this is where Goldman Sachs and a few other cagey commodity traders stepped in with one of the greatest trades of all time.**

Global trade had ground to a halt. The world economies were haemorrhaging.  There was not a lot of shipping going on.  Shipping rates plummeted.

These astute traders realized that they could rent oil super tankers for extended periods of time at incredible bargains, fill it with oil, tell the captain to circle the block for the next year, and then deliver into the forward futures they had sold. It was bloody brilliant. No better than brilliant &#8211; genius!<figure style="width: 567px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

As a trader all I could do was tip my hat to these guys in a sign of the upmost respect. These guys had figured out a way to take advantage of the steep curve and mint themselves a fortune in the process.

A lot of younger traders are impressed with the flashy traders that get on CNBC and tell everyone how smart they are.  Not me.  I have seen enough of these guys to know that often these guys are most often simply the most aggressive and optimized for the current environment.

On my team I would much rather have the kind of trader that comes up with the sort of out of the box thinking that was required in this crude oil trade.  This is the kind of trade we should all hold in reverence.  **It was truly a super star trade that will go down in the history books as one of the slickest moves out there.**

Today the curve is suffering not from a steepness, but instead a wicked backwardation:<figure id="attachment_13231" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Instead of bidding the price of the deferred futures higher, the market has the farther months trading at big discounts to the spot price.

Today spot WTI crude is approximately $97. Delivery for the end of the year is $90. For the end of 2015, it is $85. The price keeps getting lower all the way to December of 2020 (the last month with decent open interest), where it is trading at $75.

Why is this? Basically the market is convinced that the ever increasing supply for oil will continue for the next decade. There are more participants that either want to hedge their production or speculate on the price going down than there are participants willing to take the other side of the bet.

I am a long run energy bull. At the end of the day, I believe that nature put this wonderfully efficient energy source under the earth, and that we are digging up and burning it like it is an infinite energy source with little regard for the long run consequences.

Most people don&#8217;t understand how truly amazing a barrel of oil is. Neither do most realize how much of man&#8217;s progress has been the direct result of this truly magnificent energy source.

And for a long time, it was even more unbelievable in that the cost of extracting this energy was unbelievably low.

However, over the decades, we have gradually worked our way through the easy stuff. And then for a little while in the mid 2000s, there was some concern that maybe all the &#8220;peak oil&#8221; guys would be right and prices exploded higher.

But then an amazing thing happened. The oil price rose to a point where we could &#8220;mine&#8221; it out of the oilsands. And then another technological breakthrough called horizontal drilling made all the previously trapped oil economical to extract.

This has created a seeming abundance of oil. And it has created an environment where market participants are sanguine about the price of oil &#8211; reinforcing their belief about the &#8220;ingenuity of the human spirit&#8221; which will always figure it out.

I have no doubt that humans will come up with new ways to produce oil. But where I differ from most is that I think it will take ever increasing higher prices of oil to engineer this new supply. The original Ghawar field in Sauda Arabia is by far the world&#8217;s largest oil field. It was discovered in 1948 and measures 8,400 square kilometres. It is still pumping oil at a fierce rate.  The cost of this oil is basically zero. Now let&#8217;s compare that to new supply that has come on in the last decade. I am not sure of the exact numbers, but I think that oil sands need $80 or $90 to be economical. At the price of $75 where the long term contracts are trading, I think there is very little new supply that would be able to be profitably added.

Let&#8217;s go back to the crude oil commodity curve.  No one wants to buy the deferred contracts because they all believe that human ingenuity will bring about an ever increasing oil supply. Now maybe they are right, but there is another input that I think they are ignoring.

Today there is very little worry about inflation. US 5 year break-even rates are running a little below 2%.

But let&#8217;s just assume that the crude oil spot price merely follows the price of inflation over the next 7 years until December 2020. That would mean that the $97 barrel would turn into a $111.42 barrel.

Now, let&#8217;s imagine what happens if Yellen overshoots a little and achieves 3% inflation. That would mean a $119.30 barrel.

And what about if things get a little bubbly? What if there is a 5% inflation that crude oil matches? That would mean a $136.49 price.

Obviously crude oil does not need to follow inflation. Nor does inflation even need to be positive, let along 2%,3% or 5%.

But when you are buying a barrel of crude for delivery in December 2020 at a discount of 22% to today&#8217;s spot price, there is a fair amount of cushion in the trade.

The deferred contracts are not only priced for ever increasing supply, but they are also not taking into account the possibility of a sustained period of inflation.

Many of the &#8220;bunker monkey&#8221; types like to buy gold because of what they view as the coming collapse of the fiat money system.  Although I understand that argument, I think that crude oil is at least as attractive as gold as a hard asset hedge.

Gold has value because of thousands of years of society using it as a store of value.  From an industrial point of view, gold is not really that valuable.

But stop and think about crude oil.  It is an storable energy source.  Energy is fundamentally valuable in that you can turn it into things like food and shelter.  It is at the heart of why our society is so prosperous.  Take out crude oil and see what the world&#8217;s GDP would be.

If you told me that the world&#8217;s monetary system was going to be reset and you could own only one hard asset for the next decade, although the natural inclination would be to choose gold, I think I might choose crude oil.  I know that in the heart of the panic that gold would out perform, but in the long run, energy is much more fundamentally valuable and would hold its purchasing power without the emotional swings of gold.

Now maybe I am wrong.  Maybe I am like the traders who were stocking up on whale blubber because they saw the supply of whales shrinking.  Maybe human ingenuity will find a new cheap source of energy that makes crude oil obsolete.  Maybe our technology at extracting oil will get even better and it will become cheaper to extract the remaining oil from the earth.

However, if I am not wrong, then buying far month futures crude oil futures contracts will prove to be a very profitable endeavour.

Think about all the things that need to go right for the seller of the December 2020 futures contract at $75 to make money.  We need to have very little inflation.  We need to continue to figure out cheap ways to extract oil from the ground.  We need to not be running out of oil.  And finally, something we have not yet discussed, we need to have demand stay relatively flat (something that I also disagree with given China&#8217;s emergence as a new economic power).

Any one of these things turns out to be incorrect, and I think the seller of the deferred futures contract loses.

I am long various months of crude oil contracts out the curve as a hedge that the market is much too optimistic of nothing going wrong&#8230;

**Positions**

****UPDATE: Short Yen.****  Gingerly re-entering the short side throughout this week.  Conviction 2

**Short JGB futures.  **I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Short Euro.** On Friday I initiated a short position in the Euro. Conviction 4

**Short S&P 500.    **I covered half of my position on Friday, and although it was still a good trade, let&#8217;s hope I don&#8217;t take off the other half right before the next big dip!  Conviction 2

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
