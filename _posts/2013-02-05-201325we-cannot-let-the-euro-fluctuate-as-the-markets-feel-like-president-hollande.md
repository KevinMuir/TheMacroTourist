This morning the small two day correction in the Euro has been replaced with the resumption of the Euro&#8217;s steady push higher.  I have spoken at length about how this Euro strength is the result of the ECB being the tightest of the major Central Banks.

Until there is a dramatic change in the ECB&#8217;s policies, it will be difficult for the Europeans to fight against the onslaught of liquidity emanating from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.  The Euro will continue to rise, especially against the Europeans&#8217; biggest competitor &#8211; the Japanese.

The Euro Yen cross rate is even more unwieldy than the USDJPY in its ascent:

Although the Germans might be able to sit back and handle the pressures associated with a relatively strong currency, the rest of Europe cannot.

It is very telling that French President Hollande that has shown very little patience in dealing with this Euro strength:

> &#8220;We cannot let the euro fluctuate as the markets feel like,&#8221; &#8211; Hollande

Clearly he is advocating entering the currency war with guns blazing.  The French economy will not be able to withstand an expensive currency and Hollande knows it.

It is only a matter of time until the rest of Europe joins Hollande in a call for a lower Euro.

We all know that everyone can&#8217;t have a weaker currency, but gosh darn it, it seems like we sure are going to try.

You know what to do&#8230;
