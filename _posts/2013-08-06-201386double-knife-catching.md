Here&#8217;s a spread trade that I am putting on this morning that is in essence fading two monster moves in two different assets.  These two assets used to be more correlated, but over the last few months they have wildly diverged.

For the previous couple of years the S&P500 was strangely correlated to the AUDJPY cross rate.

Here is the chart of the S&P500/AUDJPY spread analysis:

The bottom sub chart represents the correlation between the two assets.  You will see that during 2011 the correlation steadily increased from 0.60 to above 0.80 at its peak in 2012.

Here is the chart of the two assets during the period of high correlation:

It doesn&#8217;t take a rocket scientist to realize that during this period these two assets tracked very closely.

However, over the last few months this relationship has completely disintegrated as the S&P 500 has zoomed to new highs while the AUDJPY has plunged to new lows.

I think this trade is way, way overdone.  The China bears have pushed AUD too low and the US bulls have become too optimistic about the S&P.

I am not going to bother going through all the fundamental reasons for this position &#8211; this is more of a &#8216;feel&#8217; trade.  I think it &#8216;feels&#8217; like a big reversion between these two assets is due.  Let&#8217;s hope the double knife catching doesn&#8217;t cost me any fingers.

I am buying AUDJPY and shorting S&P 500 futures against it.
