Over the last couple of decades, the investing public has repeatedly been decimated by chasing hot asset classes. During the 1990s, they were lured into buying DotCom stocks at obscene prices. After that market crashed, the public vowed to never again be fooled with hot stock markets and instead leveraged up in the &#8220;can&#8217;t lose&#8221; investment of real estate. We all know how that worked out for the average American, so it was no surprise that in the last few years, they have sought the safety of fixed income. Although that bubble has cooled of late, they are still in the process of learning how painful it is to chase even safe assets to absurd levels. 

The consequence of all of this massive wealth destruction in the portfolios of the average investing individual is that there has been a huge exodus from the public stock markets. Increasingly stocks are not traded by individuals, but instead these markets are now dominated by professionals. 

As I have watched this phenomenon increase, I have become more and more aware that the &#8216;smart money&#8217; has now become the consensus. In the old days hedge funds would buy a stock or an asset class. Then maybe some smarter institutions would get on board. Towards the end, the public and the late institutional accounts would make the top by buying it from the early and smarter hedge funds. 

Today there is no public to sell it to at inflated levels &#8211; they are busy chasing fixed income at negative real yields. The more traditional buy side institutions are less and less a factor, **while the hedge funds are increasingly dominating the trading of most assets.**

This has profound implications for professional traders such as myself. Whereas before I would take comfort in knowing that smarter hedge funds had similar positions to mine, I now dread it when I notice that hedge fund consensus is similar to my view. Positions held by hedge funds have now become like the Hotel California &#8211; you can check out by you can never leave. There is simply no investing public to take the position off the hedge fund&#8217;s hands. **Therefore trading has increasingly become a game of hedge funds front running hedge funds.**

Which brings us to today. 

I am very concerned that the consensus amongst the hedge fund community is that Ben Bernanke&#8217;s aggressive monetary easing has forced them out the risk curve into stocks. Time and time again I have heard the words, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like it, but I am buying stocks because it is the only game in town.&#8221; The latest un-tapering incident has solidified this theme and even the most ardent bear seems to have capitulated by venturing out the risk curve.

Hedge funds are assuming there will be a greater fool that will buy their stocks. The public is both broke and fed up with Wall Street&#8217;s games &#8211; they are not returning to the market anytime soon. Although currently the market is rising as the hedge funds becoming increasingly emboldened, they are inflating an asset to which there is no buyers. 

The trading of gold over the last few years yields a great example of a similar situation. The hedge funds all talked themselves into a lather about the investing merits of gold. As they bought it, the price went up, which only further convinced them that they were correct. This self reinforcing cycle continued until the point where GLD was the number one holding for a lot of hedge funds. Then in a sickening swoon, the hedge funds realized that there was no real bids below and GLD dropped 30% in a few months. Now the hedge funds are in the process of liquidating their gold holdings and the Asian countries are craftily taking them out of their position. The important lesson was that **you do not want to be on the side of the hedge funds &#8211; they are consensus.**

Stocks are in the process of rising as hedge funds become increasingly invested. I am not sure if we are at the point of maximum saturation or not, but I do want to point out that just because some smart hedge fund manager is getting bullish is no reason to join the party. Remember &#8211; he is now consensus. Once he buys, there is no one left!
