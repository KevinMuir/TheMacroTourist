Although I have been quite bullish on the equity market, I am beginning to have some worries that the rally might be getting a little ahead of itself.  I still would not advocate outright shorting this rally, but I am continuing to lighten up on my long positions into this relentless strength.  Whereas a month ago I was quite lonely in my bullishness, I no longer find myself quite as lonesome.

As opposed to owning risk assets, I think a better trade from a risk reward perspective might be to short fixed income.  The common push back to this position is that the Fed is buying US Treasuries so why on earth would you fade the Fed?  I have discussed this fallacy in the past.  If the Fed is successful in what they are trying to accomplish, then the worst asset to own will be the very one they are buying.

Right now, I like the shorting fixed income trade way more than I do the long risk assets trade.

I had written this long piece explaining my reasoning, but it was boring and full of long term macro analysis.  Instead I decided a much better argument was to just present this set of questions:

  * do you think the Fed ‘printing’ money actually creates any real wealth?
  * if not, what do you think will be the eventual result of the Fed’s printing?
  * if you answered **inflation** to the last question, which market do you think will have the biggest reaction to a renewed bout of inflation?  will stocks rally more because of their real return characteristic than bonds fall because of their sensitivity to inflation?
  * if you have trouble answering that one, ask yourself which market is least priced for a return of inflation &#8211; stocks or bonds?

I don’t have much trouble answering any of those questions.  Although I do think stocks will rally over the short to medium term, in the long term, the Fed’s printing does not create any real wealth.

In this environment, the bond market is an accident waiting to happen.  It has been slowly rolling over during the last couple of months, but the move has just begun.

Over the last two decades the Fed’s expansionary monetary policies have caused assets that seemed ‘good’ at the time to go up.  In the 1990s it was stocks. In the 2000s it was houses.  Although we now know there were negative consequences to these rises, at the time, the liquidity fuelled bubbles felt good.

These ‘benign’ bubbles are behind us.  The Fed’s liquidity is going to go into things that they don’t want.  The days of printing and enjoying the benefits through rising asset markets are long gone.

To bet on stocks rising over the short run might be the correct bet.  But eventually the bond market is going to revolt.  It is priced for perfection and as the economy starts to accelerate, the result might be disastrous.

Ask yourself, would you rather bet on the Fed being able to levitate stocks in another bubble?  Or would you rather bet they get the inflation equation wrong and create a vicious bear market in fixed income?  I know my answer&#8230;
