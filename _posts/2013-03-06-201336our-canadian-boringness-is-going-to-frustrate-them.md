I have been a big bear on the commodity currencies in general.  This has included the Canadian dollar and I have been lucky enough to have ridden this big move lower.

However, I am headed to the sidelines as this trade has become extremely crowded.

Remember that these hedge funds move in packs, and when they are stuffed full of a position, it is time to wait on the sidelines until the weaker members get shaken off.

The Canadian rate market has priced in an increased chance of the Bank of Canada easing in the coming months.  I have gotten this trade dead wrong, but the CAD short has more than made up for my interest rate losses.  However, with the lifting of the CAD foreign exchange short, I will be exposing myself to a direct bet that the Canadian economy does not weaken significantly from here.

I am comfortable with this exposure as I feel that the Canada bears have pushed their thesis too hard too fast.

Have a look at the March 2014 BAX future:

You will notice that the contract has rallied by over 25 basis points.  The whole curve has shifted higher.  Have a look at this chart that shows the BAX futures curve today and a month ago:

Whereas a month ago the curve was pricing in an increasing chance of tightening for 2013, it is now virtually flat all the way out to June of 2014.

Although I am bearish on the Canadian economy due to what I view will be the eventual bursting of the Chinese credit bubble, we are at a point where it makes sense to bet that things are not quite as bad as the Canada bears believe.

I am noticing an increasing number of macro traders pushing the Canada housing bubble is bursting thesis.  I am by no means bullish on Canadian housing, but I believe these bears are mistakenly believing this decline looks more like the previous US housing cycle than will actually be the case.

**Like all things Canadian, we are going to be much more middle of the road than these bears believe.  Our &#8216;boringness&#8217; is going to frustrate them.**

I am willing to take the other side of their trade in front of today&#8217;s Bank of Canada&#8217;s meeting.  I think that the BoC will not be raising rates anytime soon, but neither are we going to be lowering them as many hedge funds are betting.  I have lifted my CAD short and remain short CAD front end of the curve BAX futures outright.
