Today is Canadian Thanksgiving, and there will be no MacroTourist post. I am taking the day off to be with the family and trying to remember what's really important in life.

I leave you with the immortal words of the great philosopher Ferris Bueller:

Happy Thanksgiving!
  
And thanks for your support throughout the year,
