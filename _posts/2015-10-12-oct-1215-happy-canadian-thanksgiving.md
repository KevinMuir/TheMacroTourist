Today is Canadian Thanksgiving, and there will be no MacroTourist post. I am taking the day off to be with the family and trying to remember whatâ€™s really important in life.

I leave you with the immortal words of the great philosopher Ferris Bueller:

<div style="width: image width px; font-size: 80%; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://themacrotourist.com/pictures/FerrisOct0915.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-14271" style="padding-top: 1.0em; padding-bottom: 0.5em;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/pictures/FerrisOct0915.png" alt="%cliboard" width="600" height="300" /></a>
</div>

Happy Thanksgiving!
  
And thanks for your support throughout the year,
