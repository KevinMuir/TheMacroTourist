In a previous post I mentioned the fact that I believe that gold and Apple are both suffering from additional selling due to the upcoming change of the capital gains rate.

Due to the enormity of the monetary expansion that is on track for next year, I am going to focus on trading gold as I think it will be the bigger direct beneficiary.

Given this morning’s big sell off in the S&P futures (down 23 handles as I write this), I understand if you are rightly worried about the politicians messing things up so badly that we experience a more dramatic ‘risk off’ plunge.  Although I do not believe that will happen, I already have enough long exposure and have no interest in adding more.

Therefore I would love to find trades that might work in either outcome.  Given gold’s over sold nature, I think trading it on a spread basis versus other risk assets makes a lot of sense.

Let’s have a look at the chart of gold:

You will notice that it has been struggling since September.  From a high of almost $1800 we have now sold off to $1650.  I am no technician, but the $1625 area seems to offer quite a lot of support.

The S&P 500’s chart looks very different.  It also hit a high in September, but it has managed to almost retrace back to that level.

When you have a look at the ratio of Gold to the S&P 500, gold’s recent massive underperformance is obvious.

From a ratio high of almost 1.28 in November, we have now sunk all the way down to 1.14.

Although this very much resembles a catching fall knives trade, I am buying gold and shorting S&Ps at a 1.14 ratio.  I think the long term support level holds.

I would just buy gold outright, but from a risk reward perspective, this might be a better way to play it.
