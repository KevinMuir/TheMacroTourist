Over the last week the market has rallied smartly on expectations that a deal will be reached to avoid the fiscal cliff, and that Ben Bernanke&#8217;s merry crew at the Federal Reserve will usher in QE4.  I have written at length about the fiscal cliff saga, so I don&#8217;t want to bother rehashing that issue, but I would like to address the idea that at the conclusion of tomorrow&#8217;s two day Fed meeting they will introduce a new program of Quantitative Easing to replace the expiring Operation Twist.

According to Bloomberg, &#8220;Forty-eight of 49 economists predict the Federal Open Market Committee will purchase Treasuries to bolster an existing program to buy $40 billion in mortgage bonds each month.&#8221;  Not only does it seem to be almost unanimous, but there also seems to be a fair amount of optimism regarding the size of the program (from the same article):

I find the certainty of these economists quite perplexing.  Yes, I agree that the Fed will most likely institute QE4 &#8211; at the latest by the end of the first quarter of 2013, but I am not nearly as confident that this will be the meeting to do so.

The US economy is running at a 2.5% growth rate, and although employment is lagging, the latest non-farm payrolls report exceeded expectations.  Granted the expectations were low, but there can be no denying that at the very least, the unemployment situation is not getting any worse.

Given the extraordinary amount of stimulus that the Fed has already applied, this hardly seems like the conditions that warrant stepping on the monetary accelerator.  Monetary policy operates with an extremely long lag and the recent QE3 (aka QE infinity) was only recently implemented.  At the very least it would seem prudent to wait a quarter or two to evaluate that program&#8217;s efficacy before expanding the easing with QE4.

Short term inflation expectations have recently come down, but the important measure that the Fed watches, the 5 year 5 year forward break even rate is actually bumping up against previous highs:

This again is hardly the environment that screams out for the Federal Reserve to be increasing their easing program.

I was already leaning towards the opinion that the market had become too optimistic about the chances of QE4 at this meeting when I read this great blog post from Bob McTeer.  Mr. McTeer is a former FOMC President, and over the years I have found his writings to be extremely helpful in understanding the type of thinking that goes through the heads of the members of the FOMC.  Bob&#8217;s latest post about the current environment was as usual, extremely well laid out:

> Well, it looks like our leaders have chosen not to put a fence at the top of the fiscal cliff, but to count on an ambulance at the bottom to clean up the mess. We only have three weeks to go before we find out how messy it will be. I don’t have an informed opinion on that, but I do have a strong opinion that the Federal Reserve should lay low until it is resolved one way or another. More specifically, at the FOMC meeting on December 11 and 12, the members should do nothing new. Positive measures would only help enable further inaction.

> Doing something will be tempting since the FOMC’s so-called operation twist is scheduled to expire at year-end. The most likely measure would be to add some Treasuries, probably long-term, to the monthly MBS purchases of $40 billion per month, and cease offsetting the Treasury purchases with sales of shorter-term paper. This would end the sterilization of those Treasury purchases and cause the Fed’s assets to grow faster and presumably create money at a faster rate. To date, since QE3 was announced on September 13, a graph of the Fed’s total assets shows very little growth. Likewise, the M2 money supply has grown at an 8.4 percent rate in the three months ending November 28, not much more that the 7.3 percent growth over the past year. Actual inflation and potential inflation remain tame, as evidenced by recent prices of gold, the dollar, and TIPS. So, the temptation to do more will be great.
