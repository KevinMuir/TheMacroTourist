For those of you who are bullish, I have some terrible news for you. I covered half of my short S&P position on Friday. There is no greater sign out there that the shit is really about to hit the fan than when I finally, after weeks of fighting the market, ring the register on a decent portion of the position.

You see, over the years, I have seen this play out time and time again. I get bullish or bearish on a market. I put on a position, it goes against me. I manage it, maybe cover some, maybe let it ride. I put more on, I take it off, constantly trying to improve my cost base while keeping the risk tight. I keep bobbing and weaving until the market finally starts going my way. After weeks (and sometimes months) of fighting, there is finally a little plus sign on the position P&L column. Then, like an idiot, I cover at the first meaningful move my way&#8230;

And in doing so, I lock in a gain, but proceed to watch from the sidelines as my trade then proceeds to go many multitudes farther than I would have ever guessed.

So for those that think that maybe my covering a decent portion of my position might mark the bottom &#8211; all I can say is that this has traditionally never been the case.

If I understand this tendency within myself, you might be asking yourself why I didn&#8217;t just let it all ride? Well truth be told, I desperately want to cover almost all of it (which would be an extremely bearish signal), but I am forcing myself to remember that although we are oversold and well overdue for a bounce back higher, markets do not always let you time the wiggles and squiggles quite so neatly, and that by getting cute hoping for a bounce to re-short, I run the risk of missing the big picture trade.

I am torn between trying to time a short term rally, and the fact that I think that the next big move is lower.

So given that my short trades have moved a considerable way onto the positive side of the ledger, I thought discretion was the better part of valour and it was time to ring the register on a portion.

The other convincing factor that tipped the scales in terms of pulling the trigger on covering half the position was the fact that my portfolio was beginning to look a lot like one of those bunker monkeys. You know the type &#8211; guys who are always short stocks, long gold, spouting off a constant endless diatribe about the manipulation of financial markets by Central Banks.

Too many of my positions were all negatively correlated to risk ssets. Short S&P500, short European stocks, long gold, long Yen &#8211; this is a dangerous leveraged cocktail of negative beta trades. Over the last couple of weeks, they have been working for me, but it was time to cover some.

So on Friday, I halved my S&P 500 futures position and also my long Yen position. They have both been good winners and it is time for me to reduce risk.

Just don&#8217;t mistakenly think it signals anything bullish&#8230;<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

**More portfolio moves on Friday**

On Friday, I covered half of my position of short S&P 500 futures, and also covered half of my Yen long. Both of these trades have been moving my way and it was time to ring the register on a portion. I will be (hopefully) letting the rest ride and resisting the urge to get cute and trying to time a bounce.

But I also made some other portfolio shifts. I covered all of the Canadian dollar. There is no real reason for covering except that it feels over crowded and stretched to the downside. Who knows if I prematurely exited this position. I know the Canadian dollar bears are quite vocal in their belief that we are headed a lot lower, but their confidence scares me. I will leave the next down leg for them to enjoy.

I also instituted a **new position of short Euro currency.** I am going to write it up properly in the coming days, but this morning I am running late and just wanted to let you know the moves that I made on Friday.

<hr size="2" width="85%" />

**Positions**

**NEW POSITION: Short Euro.** On Friday I initiated a short position in the Euro. Conviction 4

**UPDATE COVERED Short Canadian dollar.**    Covered the short CAD on Friday.

**UPDATE Short S&P 500.    **It has gone a my way and it is time to lighten up. I covered half the position on Friday. Conviction 2

****UPDATE Long Yen.****  I covered half the long Yen position on Friday. Conviction 2

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
