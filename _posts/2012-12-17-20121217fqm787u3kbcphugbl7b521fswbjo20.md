Here is an idea that is a little off my regular path, but one that I feel offers a compelling risk reward.  I found it from a research report issued by Makor Capital.  Although I am not familiar with this brokerage firm, I have been following their research on the Bloomberg for the last year.  During this time, I  have been impressed and find their analysis to be top notch.

Last week Hong Leong Co. Bhd announced a bid for the 28.5% of Guoco Group (quote symbol 53 HK Equity on the Bloomberg) that it did not own.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/53%20HK%20Dec%2017%2012.gif" />

Hong Leong Co. Bhd is controlled by the Quek family which is one of Malaysia’s most prominent families.

Guoco Group (53 HK Equity) is a holding company that owns substantial stakes in various Asian financial companies.  It is comprised of the following:

  * Guoco Land (GUOL SP Equity) 24.3% &#8211; develops and invests in properties as well as providing investment trading, underwriting, fund management and advisory services.
  * Hong Leong Financial GP (HLFG MK Equity) &#8211; 18.4% &#8211; provides a range of banking and financial services which include consumer, commercial, investment and insurance.
  * Guocoleisure Ltd (GLL SP Equity) &#8211; 7.9% &#8211; an investment holding company whose portfolio includes hotels, resorts and other assets
  * AIA Group (1299 HK Equity) &#8211; 8.3% &#8211; offers insurance and financial services.
  * Bank of East Asia (23 HK Equity) &#8211; 19.2% &#8211; another bank
  * Rank Group PLC (RNK LN Equity) &#8211; 10.8% &#8211; international leisure and entertainment company

The Quek family is attempting to take out the minority shareholders of this holding company and at first blush, the HK $88 per share offer seems appropriate.  This bid represented a premium of a little more than 24% from the previous day’s trading.  However, with a little more digging, it becomes apparent that this bid is extremely opportunistic.

On the day before the bid announcement, Guoco Group (53 HK Equity) was trading at a price of a little more than HK $70.  However, the NAV of this company was more than HK $145.  At first I thought that can’t be right, why on earth would a holding company trade at more than a 50% discount, especially when the underlying assets were all listed equities?  But putting pen to paper, I confirmed those numbers were correct.  Welcome to the strange inefficient world of Asian equities.

The HK $88 bid by the Quek family therefore still represents a 40% discount to the NAV.  For the Quek family, if they were able to buy it at this price, it would result in a huge financial win.  They would in essence be buying the rest of their assets at a massive discount.

Which brings us to the most important question.  Are the minority shareholders going to tender their shares to the bid?

The Makor report highlights that a portion of the minority shares are held by ‘active’ value investors that will attempt to negotiate a much more appropriate discount to NAV.  It is difficult to argue with this logic.  As I read through the news for this company I notice that other shareholders are also publicly lambasting the bid.  In a Bloomberg news item, Sandy Mehta, Hong Kong based chief executive office of Valu Investment Principals Ltd, which owns Guoco’s shares, said in a phone interview &#8211; “For them to offer HK $88 is just absurd.”

The minority shareholders can moan all they want about the low price of the bid, but the real question is what happens from here?

The stock has risen above the bid price and is now trading at HK $92.  The market has priced in an increased chance that Quek will increase his bid to complete the deal.

The fact that the discount to NAV was so large before the bid intrigued us to investigate this further.  We decided to do a little more research to measure whether this was a new phenomenon, or whether this was a chronic discount.  The chart below shows the HK $ discount of Guoco Group versus the underlying assets over the last 5 years.

You will notice that it has been a steady drift lower, with a dramatic widening to the ‘stupid’ levels seen over the last couple of months before the bid emerged.

Quek could afford to pay another HK $10 or $20 and still be purchasing Guoco at a massive discount to NAV and at a level that is line with a discount of where it used to trade.

A long position is obviously tempting, but in terms of executing this trade, there are a couple of different issues.

The first one is the fact that this is a stock trading on the Hong Kong exchange.  Although many brokers offer access to the Hong Kong equity market, I am going to trade the Guoco Group ADR in NY.  The symbol is GULRY and each ADR represents 2 Guoco Group shares.

The next concern is whether to hedge the stock market and currency risk.

I have been somewhat bearish on the Chinese economy over the last year, but with the massive easing from the Federal Reserve, combined with the new government in Japan that was elected on an aggressive monetary easing platform, I feel that we are about to go through a global economic upswing.  I therefore am not as concerned about the equity market risk, and in fact, I am looking for low risk long positions.  When a wealthy smart Asian businessman tries to buy back his shares, I figure that he probably knows more than most, and that the long position is warranted.

As for the currency risk.  The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, so there is very little risk on that front.  In fact, lately the HKD has been bumping up against its upper band limit, which means that the authorities are forced to sell HKD, thus increasing the money supply.  If there was to be a currency revaluation, it would most likely be a revaluation upward which would be beneficial to our long Guoco Group position.  Therefore the currency risk is basically a non-issue.

There is always a chance that the minority holders over play their hand and Quek does not raise his bid.  I suspect if that happened the stock would indeed slump.  However, I do not believe that it would go back to the old discount as the market would embed a greater chance of Quek eventually returning.

I think the correct position is to assume that the smart value guys are going to squeeze Quek for a little more, and that he will be happy (at least on a relative basis) to pay up as he will still be buying the minority group out at a discount.

I like buying assets, in what I think is a rising market, at a discount.  I like buying these assets after a really smart insider has shown me that he sees value in the security, even more.

I am buying 53 HK (GULRY), playing for a bump.
