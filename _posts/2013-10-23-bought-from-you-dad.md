There is a story in Market Wizards where one of the profiled traders talks about getting bullish on equities in the early 1980s. At the time there was no index futures or ETFs, so for a hedge fund manager to buy stocks he had to actually buy each stock individually. Now you have to remember that at this point, stocks were unloved &#8211; no make that downright hated. This was when the famous death of equities hit the cover of BusinessWeek:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/0918_MagazineCover1.jpg" alt="0918 MagazineCover1" title="0918_MagazineCover1.jpg" border="0" width="278" height="395" />

The hedge fund manager did not trust himself to be bullish enough as the decade long bear market had left him scarred. So his solution to the problem was pure genius. Instead of picking stocks himself (where he would have probably chosen conservative low risk names), he hired a couple of young punks straight out of business school and told them to put the money to work in the stock market. He figured that they were too young to be scared &#8211; which was exactly what he wanted. They did indeed load his portfolio up with the most aggressive go-go names of the time and the hedge fund manager made out like a bandit as one of the greatest equity bull markets of all time embarked.

As I read about Carl Icahn&#8217;s recent stellar pass in Netflix, this story immediately sprung to my mind. 

Although everyone thinks that Carl was the stock picking guru behind the Netflix trade, it was actually Carl&#8217;s son and his hedge fund manager partner that came up with the idea. The two of them were the ones that convinced Carl to back up the truck on Netflix. And it turned into a spectacular trade. I think they bought NFLX south of $100.

Carl recently admitted that he actually wanted to sell it a hundred dollars ago when it was still trading with a 2 handle. Again his son and his business partner convinced Carl to hang on. 

However, yesterday&#8217;s rip higher proved too much for Carl and he pulled the trigger on the sell ticket. 

Many market commentators have been blaming yesterday&#8217;s dramatic outside reversal on Carl&#8217;s selling. But let&#8217;s remember that NFLX traded over 25 million shares. Carl was only 3 of that. To blame Carl is just plain dumb.

No, the market had a big outside reversal day because speculation had simply become too rampant. The stock was massively overbought and not trading on anything but momentum. 

Carl, the bat shit crazy old bugger that he is, simply recognized that fact and as my old boss used to say, &#8220;filled them like a butter tart.&#8221;

Now, this is where the story gets really interesting and reminds me most of the story from the market wizards about the old trader and the young fresh recruits. 

In the 13d filing, Carl documented that the two younger portfolio managers still didn&#8217;t want to sell the NFLX position. But the really interesting part is that Carl agreed to pay them _based as if they still owned it._ So to some extent Carl actually shorted NFLX because he is still responsible for the performance to the upside. The astute reader will notice that Carl did not sell all of his position, so there is still a long hedge, but I find this fascinating.

First of all, can you imagine negotiating with your Dad about a $900+ million dollar internet stock position that you have a 400% gain on? That must make a pretty interesting Thanksgiving day dinner table conversation.

Secondly, what kind of cajones do you have that you don&#8217;t want to peel any part of your position off? And when your old man (who was responsible for most of your wealth) finally says enough is enough, we have to sell some, instead of just accepting it as a job well done, you get him to write you a contract that pays you based on the return as if you hadn&#8217;t sold any. 

When I sit back and think about this story, it feels to me as if the experiment with the young fresh traders has reached its climax and the cagey old trader has realized that their over confidence has gone too far. 

As much as I find Carl grating, there is no denying that he is a master trader. I am not sure that I would want to be on the other side of any of his trades. I will leave that to his son&#8230;
