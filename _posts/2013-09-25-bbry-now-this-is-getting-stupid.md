I understand all the problems with Prem Watsa&#8217;s BBRY subject bid. I get it and I am not suggesting that it is a slam dunk by any means, but this morning&#8217;s dip to $8.09 is just plain dumb.

I am standing in here and taking the other side of the doubters&#8217; trade. Getting aggressively long BBRY &#8211; details to follow.
