The MacroTourist is on vacation. Actually I hope I am on vacation, as I have been banned from Canada's main airline when some joker took a picture of me getting comfortable on a recent flight and posted it to Instagram:

According to the airline my "recent publicity has resulted in an unfavourable reflection of the airline and therefore I am no longer welcome."  I mean really, who hasn't stripped down to their boxers and t-shirt for a little nap on a business flight?

Regular letter writing will resume some time during the week of March 21st to 25th.

Thanks for stopping by,
