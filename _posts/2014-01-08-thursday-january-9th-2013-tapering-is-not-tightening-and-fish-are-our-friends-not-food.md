Let me just start off this post by confessing that yesterday I sold my US treasury curve steepeners. Although I was onside for most of the fall as the spread blew out to new wides, I overstayed my welcome and turned the trade into a loss. I am actually a little bit ticked at myself as I am a big bond bear, but I was scared about being outright short and instead felt that given the Fed&#8217;s shift from direct (QE type stimulus) to indirect (forward rate guidance) that being long steepeners was a good way to play the coming bond bear market.  I thought wrong.

Not realizing it, it turns out that my view must have been consensus.

With yesterday&#8217;s release of the Fed&#8217;s minutes, the curve continued its dramatic flattening move, with the 5/30 year spread falling 8 basis points to 212:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The market is obviously viewing any withdrawal of QE as one step closer towards a tightening and is ignoring the Fed&#8217;s plea that &#8220;tapering is not tightening&#8221;.

Whenever I see someone on TV uttering this phrase, I can&#8217;t help but be reminded of the sharks from the Disney movie &#8220;Finding Nemo.&#8221; In the movie, the sharks are in therapy to stop eating other fish and have a mantra that they repeat to themselves &#8211; &#8220;Fish are friends, not food.&#8221;  The Fed&#8217;s &#8220;tapering is not tightening&#8221; doesn&#8217;t seem to be giving any more assurances than the sharks&#8217; promise.  And I guess that makes sense because just as the thought of the sharks not eating other fish is ludicrous, the idea that the Fed can leave the Fed Funds at 25 basis points indefinitely is just as unrealistic.

The Fed Funds future for December 2015 backed up another 10 basis points today, implying a 85 basis points Fed Funds level for Dec 2015:

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="FFDEC15Jan0814.gif" alt="FFDEC15Jan0814" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/FFDEC15Jan0814.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" />

I have long held the belief that the Federal Reserve would eventually lose control of the bond market. I had thought that given their ability to anchor the short end, that loss of control would result in a super steep yield curve. Now maybe this is what the end game will look like, but over the short run, it doesn&#8217;t seem to be playing out that way.

If there is one thing that I have learned over the years, it is that I don&#8217;t want to be in a trade where the banks, hedge funds and other levered players all have the same position. Whether it is Long Term Capital or the 2008 credit bubble, we have seen this play out way too many times with the same disastrous result every time.

It is one of the reasons that anytime I sense a trade is crowded with hedge funds, even if I think the position makes sense, I will stand aside.

Anyways, my guess is that the banks and hedge funds were playing the Fed&#8217;s Zero Interest Rate Policy by being long the shorter end of the yield curve. This is why as the writing on the wall for the end of QE becomes clearer, the leveraged players stop buying the shorter end of the yield curve. The Fed may promise that they aren&#8217;t going to raise rates, but at the end of the day, actions mean more than words. And let&#8217;s not forget about how much excess reserves are sitting on banks&#8217; balance sheets &#8211; with a fair portion of this most likely engaging in government bond arbitrage:

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

Now maybe this will ultimately be good for the economy Maybe forcing the banks out of the game of rolling 2 year notes will help the economy.  But in the mean time, if there is a large leveraged speculative position in the front end of the curve, then the last thing I want to do is be long &#8211; regardless of what the Fed promises or not.

I continue to have a firm conviction that the Fed is eventually going to lose control of the bond market.  But what if that manifests itself as some sort of strange inability to control the 2-5 year part of the curve?  Stranger things have happened and the Market Gods seem to have a way of surprising everyone and causing the most pain.

And if you think about it, to some degree it makes sense.  The Fed&#8217;s QE programs do not focus on the long end of the curve, but instead concentrate at sub 10 year durations.  Although they did engage in Operation Twist in an attempt to manipulate long rates lower, there is no doubt that they are a much bigger force in the shorter end of the curve.  As the Fed withdraws from the QE programs, this part of the curve should be most vulnerable.

Although so far the markets do not seem that concerned about the flattening yield curve and the Fed&#8217;s inability to convince everyone that &#8220;tapering is not tightening&#8221;, I am not quite as sanguine.   Towards the end of 2013 risk assets exhibited a little bit of fear regarding the tapering.  At the time I advocated not to fear the taper.  I counselled that tapering was not the cessation of buying, but merely the small reduction in the amount of already much-too-much purchases.  That proved to be wise advice (even I get the occasional call right), but since then the market has become emboldened by the fact that the taper did not cause a market dislocation and have increasingly traded with little regard to Fed communication.

I think that the release of yesterday&#8217;s Fed minutes are more important than the market realizes.  The bond market is often a more sophisticated earlier indicator than other financial asset classes and I think they got yesterday&#8217;s release right.  The Fed is becoming more hawkish than the market realizes.  From yesterday&#8217;s minutes:

> Participants were most concerned about the marginal cost of additional asset purchases arising from risks to financial stability, pointing out that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy could provide an incentive for excessive risk-taking in the financial sector.  In their discussion of potential risks, several participants commented on the rise in forward price-to-earnings ratios for some small-cap stocks, the increased level of equity repurchases, or the rise in margin credit. One pointed to the increase in issuance of leveraged loans this year and the apparent decline in the average quality of such loans.

The Fed looking at forward P/E ratios?  Margin credit?  Could it be that they learned something from the previous massive bubbles that they have blown?

Although ultimately I think the Fed will be forced to inflate their way out of the massive debt morass that has been created, that is a long run conclusion.  In the short run I believe we might be entering a period where the Fed surprises the market by being more hawkish than expected.  The bond market curve flattening might simply be the smarter bond market sniffing out this outcome.

Risk asset prices are oblivious to this possibility as we are definitely in the let the good times roll mind set.  However if I am correct that the Fed might be more aggressive on the tapering than the market expects, and that this might result in an even flatter yield curve, then I would not want to be long stocks.  Have a look at this chart of the S&P500 versus the 5/30 spread:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="SPXUS530Jan0814.gif" alt="SPXUS530Jan0814" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/SPXUS530Jan0814.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">US 5/30 Treasury Yield Spread (white) vs S&P500 (yellow)</figcaption></figure> 

During the past couple of years, stocks seemed highly correlated to the steepness of the yield curve.  However over the last couple of months, we have had a massive break down as the curve has flattened dramatically all the while stocks have rocketed straight up.

In the past an inverted yield curve was the best predictor of the end of the bull market and the onset of a recession.  In today&#8217;s strange ZIRP environment, it will obviously be a while before we get an inverted yield curve.  However maybe we should be listening to the signals from the mid to longer part of the yield curve for clues.

Let&#8217;s face it, we have never experienced the sort of massive monetary expansion that the major Central Banks have engaged in during the last 5 years.  If someone tells you they know how this is going to end, then they are an knob.  We have never been here before, so no one knows how it will end.  I suspect there are going to be a lot more surprises than most realize.  I am keeping an open mind and trying to watch for clues in the market.  I think the curve flattening and the fact that the &#8220;tapering is not tightening&#8221; mantra is failing is a bigger deal than the market realizes, but so far I just look like an old worry wart.

**Things that I am watching**

Japanese Yen

I am a big long term bear on the Japanese Yen.  I think that ultimately the Yen has to go to 150 USDJPY or even higher to fix Japan&#8217;s massive problems.

However, I think that this trade is _very popular_ with the hedge fund community.  Some of last year&#8217;s best performing funds were those that had this trade on as the Yen made a big move from 80 to 105:_

I am concerned about the possibility that this trade has become a little too crowded.  Have a look at the speculators&#8217; short open interest on the CME for Japanese Yen futures:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img class=" " style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="JPYShortJan0814.gif" alt="JPYShortJan0814" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/JPYShortJan0814.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">CME Japanase Yen Speculator Short Contracts</figcaption></figure> 

The shorts are growing quite large.  Here is the chart for the net speculative position (longs minus short):<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

It is hitting new levels of bearishness.

The Yen is quite negatively correlated with risk assets.  If there was to be correction in risk assets (I am pretty sure that sometimes stocks actually go down), then I would be worried about the Yen having a big correction as well.  As I mentioned above, I hate crowded trades and to me, the short Yen trade is crowded.  I am going to avoid it, and hopefully be there to take the other side of any dislocation that might develop in the future as this massive short position is trimmed back.

**Positions**

**New Position: Short Canadian dollar.** The USDCAD rate broke out to new highs two days ago. I added again yesterday and increased the position as this is one of my few trades that is going my way these days.  Conviction level: 4. Stops to come.

**Long various natural gas contracts UPDATE.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather and **yesterday I peeled off a quarter of my position.** Conviction level: 3 No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

****UPDATE no position &#8211;** US treasury 5-30 year steepener and the 2-30 year steepener .**  Covered position in its entirety as it is not behaving as I would expect (like).

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** Not the greatest trade so far, but I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. I have no long hedge on versus this position, but I am thinking about reinstating one into the recent weakness in the S&P 500. Conviction level: 3. No stop for now.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** I am long bond market volatility as I think the next crisis will start in the bond market. Conviction level: 3.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 6
