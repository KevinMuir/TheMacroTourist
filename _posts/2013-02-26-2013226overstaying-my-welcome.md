Yesterday was a pretty wild day in the foreign exchange square.  The Yen opened at new lows for this recent move on news that Prime Minister Abe was appointing Haruhiko Kuroda as the new BOJ head.  In terms of easing monetary policy, Mr. Kuroda is expected to be more aggressive than some of the other contenders.  Market participants were emboldened by this announcement and continued to press their short Yen bets.

However, there was very little follow through and by the time London opened, the Yen had climbed back into the recent range and looked to firmly reject the move to new lows.

Then the fireworks happened.  Although many will blame the ensuing monster move in Yen to the news that the Italian elections were a bit of a disaster for the markets, the reality is that the Yen was massively oversold with way too many weak shorts and that this sort of mad rush to the exits was going to happen regardless &#8211; we just didn&#8217;t know what the trigger would be.

Remember &#8211; &#8216;markets make news, not the other way round&#8217;.

The pain was large and relentless.  After opening up at nearly 95, the USDJPY at one point was trading with a 90 big figure.  The EURJPY traded through 6 handles as well.

### So what happens from here?

I am long term very bearish on the Yen and although I have been trading it from the long side, I think that a year from now we should be significantly lower.  I had been looking for a shakeout and was willing to trade it counter trend with the idea that I needed to stay nimble and not dig in my heels if it went against me.  I have been lucky enough to catch this move and now the question is how long do I press my luck?

In my mind this is the first day that the Yen bears were given any real worry.

Is there a chance that this correction will be a one day wonder that is quickly erased once Japanese officials resume their aggressive verbal devaluation of the Yen?  Of course.  I have under estimated how much Yen devaluation could be accomplished through this simple technique and I might make this same mistake again.

Although I am going to keep this outcome as a possibility, I don&#8217;t think it is the correct bet.  This is the first day of what I believe will be a multi-day correction.  Markets never make things easy and in my mind, it has been too easy for the Japanese government and Yen bears.

If we get another wide range day higher in Yen (lower on the chart above), then I will think about covering.  Maybe start at the 90 level and be fully flat at the 88 level.

At the same time, if we go sideways for the next few days, I will also cover.  By the end of the week I will be no longer long Yen.  Long term I am bearish on the Yen and trading counter trend is a very dangerous proposition.

I would love to see some real pain and doubt for all these newly minted Yen bears.  We need to get rid of all of these weak shorts.

Let&#8217;s hope I am not overstaying my welcome.

The Yen has careened higher and given that this is the second big up day, I am heading to the sidelines.

The volatility is high enough that we have probably scared off a lot of the weak shorts.  The CME JPY contract is whipping around at 150 pips every couple of hours.

Time to head to the sidelines&#8230;  officially flat Yen here.
