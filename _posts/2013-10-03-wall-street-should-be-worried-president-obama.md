I have been arguing that the market has been way too complacent about the latest circus in Washington. The crux of my argument is that the market is assuming that at the end of the day the politicians will do what is &#8220;right&#8221; for the country. However market participants are missing the fact that both sides are already doing what they think they have been elected to do. Therefore there is very little chance that one side will cave as both parties believe that would be a betrayal to their constituents. The fact that the financial markets has been so complacent has only made the problem all the worse as there is no real outside force to push the two different groups together.

Realizing that the process is stuck without some sort of outside pressure being applied, President Obama has gone on a campaign to attempt to scare the Republicans into giving in. 

Have a look at the latest headlines coming out the Treasury:

> TREASURY OFFICIAL: CONGRESS ACTION ONLY WAY TO AVOID DEFAULT
  
> TREASURY SEES \`TENTATIVE&#8217; SIGNS IMPASSE AFFECTING MARKETS
  
> TREASURY SAYS BILL YIELDS MAY REFLECT \`NASCENT CONCERNS&#8217;
  
> TREASURY: DEFAULT IMPACT COULD BE PROFOUND, LAST A GENERATION

Now before you start thinking that I am taking sides, put that thought away. I am not interested in who is right or wrong. My opinion about the morality of the situation is completely irrelevant.

I am only interested in analyzing what this political showdown means for the markets.

So let&#8217;s get back to President Obama&#8217;s latest attempt to apply pressure on the Republicans by talking down the markets. Barry has rightly concluded that the markets are assuming someone will blink, so the markets figure there is little sense worrying. Like any good CEO he would prefer to be in a situation of under promising and over delivering, but the problem is that the President is having trouble convincing the markets to be worried.

The Administration has for the past few weeks consistently been warning about this logjam. The Treasury Secretary Jack Lew even sent a letter dated September 25, 2013 where he warned the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Honourable John A. Boehner, that the;

> &#8220;â€¦debt limit impasse that took place in 2011 caused significant harm to the economy and a downgrade to the credit rating of the United States. The drawn-out dispute caused business certainty to increase, consumer confidence to drop, and financial markets to fall. If Congress were to repeat that brinkmanship in 2013, it could inflict even greater harm on the economy. And if the government should ultimately become unable to pay all of its bills, the results could be catastrophic.&#8221; 

The Republicans believe that the President is obligated to negotiate if he wants to pass a budget. The President and the Democrats believe that is irresponsible for the Republicans to hold the country economic hostage in an attempt to get their way.

The last paragraph of Lew&#8217;s letter sums up their belief:

> &#8220;The President remains willing to negotiate over the future direction of fiscal policy, but he will not negotiate over whether the United States will pay its bills for past commitments. Extending borrowing authority does increase government spending; it simply allows the Treasury to pay for expenditures Congress has already approved. As such, I respectfully urge Congress to act immediately to meet its responsibility by extending the nation&#8217;s borrowing authority.&#8221; 

I told you I wouldn&#8217;t give you my opinion, but I guess I can&#8217;t help myself, I tend to agree that risking the whole credit rating of the United States to try to negotiate something extra for your party is very short sighted and selfish. The problem is that the voters are not going to punish those that are doing this reckless stunt. In fact, they are so fed up with their political system that they are going to applaud.

Which brings me to the crux of the matter. Neither side has a reason to give any concessions. 

President Obama is trying to ready the markets for this eventuality, but right now the markets assign very little possibility of a disaster because it seems so avoidable. 

The bond king himself, Pimco&#8217;s Bill Gross said there was less than a million to one chance that the United States defaults on its debt. I don&#8217;t know about Bill, but I don&#8217;t feel confident enough about _anything_ to bet a million to one. If he is giving out those sorts of odds, I wouldn&#8217;t mind putting down a G note on that outcome &#8211; it is probably my only chance of ever becoming a billionaire.

President Obama invited Goldman&#8217;s Lloyd Blankfein and JP Morgan&#8217;s Jamie Dimon to the White House to try to organize some pressure on the Republicans from the financial markets. However, I don&#8217;t think it is going to matter. The Tea Party Republicans already believe that the White House has sold out to the financial powers when they bailed out the banks during the last credit crisis. I don&#8217;t think the Tea Partiers are going to fall for the &#8220;you have to do this otherwise the markets will crash&#8221; again.

Which is exactly why there is a much greater chance than the markets realize that it happens.

Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, the chances are still really low. They just aren&#8217;t million to one Bill Gross low. 

Over the last few days the President&#8217;s message is slowly getting out there and the markets might be starting to price in _some uncertainty._ I know ZeroHedge is mongering about the increase in the 5 year US CDS:

Yes, ZH is correct that it has risen in the last week. But how about stepping back and looking at a longer term chart of this security:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/FiveYrUSCDSOct0313.gif" alt="FiveYrUSCDSOct0313" title="FiveYrUSCDSOct0313.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

So when ZH asked does this look like complacency? I would answer yes! The CDS was trading 15 basis points higher 9 months ago!

Does this mean you should run out and sell everything? No, I am not saying that there won&#8217;t be a deal. I am simply saying that the market is dramatically over estimating the chances of that outcome.
