I have been arguing that the market has felt increasingly speculative of late. 

Just for fun we created an index that was equal weighted as of Dec 31, 2012 with Netflix, LinkedIn, Facebook and Tesla.

Here is the chart of the percentage appreciated plotted against the S&P 500:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/09/FOURHORSESep2613.gif" alt="FOURHORSESep2613" title="FOURHORSESep2613.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

I understand that there will always be &#8216;story&#8217; stocks that capture the speculating public&#8217;s imagination, but this has been a truly amazing run. 

Facebook with a market cap of $122.7 billion now has a higher market cap than Intel with $116.1 billion. Tesla is up over 500% since the start of the year. 

Have a look at the chart, there has barely been a dip to be bought. 

It is like the Fed is monetizing their balance sheet but instead of buying Treasuries and Mortgage backs, they are instead stamping blue tickets on our home made index.

I am not sure when this is going to end, but I am willing to bet that my index gets halved before it doubles again… This is getting extremely stretched and quite scary…
