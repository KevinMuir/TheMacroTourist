Today the Fed announced QE4.  Although it initially did have a positive effect on stocks and other risk assets, by the end of the day almost all risk assets were &#8216;offerred.&#8217;

Here is the intra day performance of the S&P 500 which best sums up the trading for today &#8211; initial excitement, followed by a sell the news reaction:

Yesterday I advocated a short position as I felt that there was a chance that the Fed would disappoint and stay on the sidelines during this period of political brinksmanship in Washington, but even if I was wrong, the news was largely &#8216;baked into&#8217; the price and the upside was limited.

This proved to be the case as today&#8217;s announcement was about as accommodative as one could reasonably expect from the Fed, yet the market still sold off.

### What does the fact that a new QE program failed to cause the stock market to rally mean?

Zerohedge has a great piece about how this is the first QE program announcement that has resulted in a red close for stocks.  In the post <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/DaKkn8AQywk/story01.htm" target="_blank">(found here)</a>, Tyler Durden contrasts the daily returns for all the QE announcement days:

I am sure that there will be many market pundits who proclaim today&#8217;s stock market performance as an indictment of the failure of Ben Bernanke&#8217;s policies.  Although Liquid Ben&#8217;s policies might in fact turn out to be long run failures, I am not going to condemn them based on the trading from one day.  I know all too well that the reaction to today&#8217;s announcement has much more to do about **what was anticipated **rather than anything else.  The market had simply fully priced in the news of QE4 and there was no one left to buy it on the actual news.__

Also, the last QE announcement where the Fed introduced the program of buying $40 billion of mortgage backed securities each month was so over hyped that the actual announcement proved to mark the top in the market to the day, with the next two months resulting in a steady drip lower.  This realization that the last QE announcement created an immediate term top in the stock market was probably fresh in many traders minds as they thought through their positions after today&#8217;s announcement.

Not only was the disappointment of the previous QE clouding their thoughts, but they also had to deal with the fact that on this FOMC meeting, the Fed introduced some guidelines for economic conditions that would trigger the FOMC to reevaluate their accommodative stance and potentially withdraw the stimulus.  This guidance was not expected until next year and it caught many off guard.  At the margin, this extra uncertainty increased the likelihood that traders would simply sell now and figure it out later.

All of this adds up to the fact that today&#8217;s trading doesn&#8217;t real mean much in the long run, but was merely the result of too much anticipation combined with a little confusion about the new policies.  Let&#8217;s not get too excited about today&#8217;s weak performance.

### Instead, let&#8217;s try to think about what today&#8217;s announcement will mean over a little longer timeframe.

When I turned on CNBC satellite radio for the car ride home, I was shocked by all the negativity I heard regarding the FOMC&#8217;s decision.  It seemed pretty universal that market participants have decided that the Fed is pushing on a string, the economy doesn&#8217;t need more stimulating, the employment problems are all structural &#8211; whatever you can think of, they were complaining about it.

Although I do understand the long term serious issues about the path the Fed has taken, I am not interested in debating how this will turn out a decade from now.  I am interested in what effect today&#8217;s decision will have for the next week, month and at most, year.

I had thought that the Fed would take a more gradual approach to this QE program.  Although I acknowledge that Operation Twist was expiring at the end of this month, I didn&#8217;t see the necessity of having a new program take its place immediately.  I believe that part of my underestimation about the Fed&#8217;s eagerness to replace Operation Twist is due to the fact that I felt it was not that effective and that it wouldn&#8217;t be missed.  The Federal Reserve obviously felt differently.

The reason that I differ with the Fed regarding the efficacy of Operation Twist is that I feel it is the change in the size of the balance sheet of the Fed that matters, while they are of the opinion that the make up and total size is much more important.  This nuance is described as the difference between the stock or flow of the balance sheet.  The Fed therefore viewed Operation Twist as important, while I felt that given the fact that it did not change the total size of their balance sheet, it was generally less effective at achieving their goals.   I was therefore not that fussed about Operation Twist ending.

However, the termination of Operation Twist obviously weighed heavily on the minds of the Federal Reserve because even though inflation expectations are somewhat elevated and at the last employment report, hirings picked up slightly, the Fed nevertheless felt the need to replace Operation Twist with QE4.

QE4 will be the purchase of up to $45 billion of new US Treasury Bonds on a monthly basis, with some discretion based on employment and inflation indicators.  At first I thought that the guidelines provided by the Fed regarding the conditions required to remove the extraordinary stimulus were automatic triggers, but during his press conference Liquid Ben was very careful to state that these were guidelines only, and that the Fed **had not tied itself to an automatic tightening program.**

Whereas I largely feel that Operation Twist was useless, I have an entirely different take on QE4.  As I mentioned, Operation Twist did not increase the size of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet.  To highlight what I feel is important, we have created a chart that shows the growth of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet over the last few years.  You will notice that contrary to the wailing of the inflation hawks, the Fed has actually not expanded its balance sheet significantly since 2010:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/50c9274be4b015d1d5e8dabe/1355360076796/Screenshot%202012-12-12%207:54%20PM.png" />

You can see that the Fed did expand it aggressively in 2008 with the introduction of QE1 and then a little bit in 2011, but since then, the rate of growth has been slowing dramatically.

Contrast that to the balance sheet of the ECB:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/50c92809e4b0a97682f9e75e/1355360266242/Screenshot%202012-12-12%207:57%20PM.png" />

You will notice that the ECB was not nearly as aggressively in 2008 (60% versus the Fed&#8217;s 140% growth),  but that recently they have been much more expansionary.

The Fed has been maintaining their balance sheet, but they have not been expanding it.  And according to my theory that the flow of the balance sheet is more important than the stock, it is no wonder that the economy has been lagging.

However, with the introduction of QE3 and QE4, the Fed is about to embark on a very expansionary campaign.  The growth will very quickly resemble the sort of balance sheet growth we have seen recently at the ECB.

### What effects will this have?

Although it now seems fashionable to decry the end of monetarism, I am not as convinced that the Fed&#8217;s expansion of the balance sheet is not going to affect risk assets in a very traditional way.  Just have a look at what the ECB&#8217;s expansion has done to stock markets across the Atlantic:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/CAC%20Dec%2012%2012.gif" /><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/DAX%20Dec%2012%2012.gif" />

Even though the economic news out of Europe is just terrible &#8211; unemployment hitting new record highs, exports way down, etc.., their stock markets are racing higher.  This is for one reason, and  one reason only &#8211; the ECB is aggressively expanding their balance sheet.  Print money and it has to find a home.  Stocks rise, even in the face of the most horrific economic catastrophe.

For those who claim that the US has been printing money with no effect, I remind them to look at the balance sheet growth in the chart above.  There has been virtually no growth over the last half of a year.  The Fed has not being printing money.  So it should be no surprise that an over indebted economy such as the US would stutter as the Fed stopped putting its foot on the accelerator.

But that is about to change&#8230; Big time.

The Fed&#8217;s QE3 program has barely started, and yet they have now just doubled the size of their planned expansion with QE4.  This isn&#8217;t pushing on the gas a little bit, this is slamming down the accelerator to the floor and popping the clutch.

There is no need to over think this.  The Fed is about to massively expand their balance sheet, at a time when other Central Banks around the world are doing the same (Swiss National Bank, Bank of Japan, ECB).  Monetary policy always works with a lag, but if you apply enough stimulus, it always finds its way into some asset.  I am not going to bother speculating about whether this is going to ultimately improve the economy for the long run (I suspect that it will end badly, but probably not for the reasons most believe), but instead just try to navigate through the next couple of quarters of trading.

In terms of positioning, I believe that given today&#8217;s announcement, it is very difficult to stay negative.  At the very least, I believe that an investor should be neutral.  The Fed has introduced the very real possibility that a massive amount of stimulus is going to be applied, at a time where the economy was already slowly improving, which might result in a liquidity fuelled blast off.   I believe that if for whatever reason the velocity of money ever started to increase, it would ignite the tremendous amount of fuel that Central Banks have  applied to the financial markets since 2008, thus causing run away inflation in either asset prices or traditional goods (or maybe both).  The important thing to realize is that there is a very real melt up risk that investors don&#8217;t appreciate.

Given the Fed&#8217;s new QE program, this risk has just increased.

I am very aware of all the negatives.  I understand the possibility that given the tremendous uncertainty in the world, the velocity of money might fall faster than Fed can expand its balance sheet, thus causing the money supply to shrink.  However, I don&#8217;t think that is the right bet from a risk reward perspective.

The market is convinced that nothing is going to work, which is the reason why the Fed is forced to be so aggressive.  Today&#8217;s sell off shows you the knee jerk reaction by traders to the idea that the Fed can help the economy.  The pessimism is quite thick in the air.  If you have the stomach, then I believe that long positions are warranted.  The Fed has told you that they will keep printing until it works.  Martin Zweig coined the phrase &#8220;don&#8217;t fight the Fed&#8221;.  For the longest time it was quite fashionable and it seemed to work.  Lately it has fallen out of favour as the Fed seems to have become increasingly impotent.  Fashion might come and go, but I am not going to dare hang up that great tip of Zweig&#8217;s from the 1980s.  I for one, am not going to fight the Fed.
