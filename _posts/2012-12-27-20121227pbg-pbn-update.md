A little over a month ago [A little over a month ago](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2012/11/20/petrobank-my-new-favourite-trade.html) as one of my favourite trades.

I just wanted to take a moment to update that position.

Unfortunatley, if you were swayed by my bullish view and put the trade on without a PetroBakken (PBN CN Equity) hedge, you are offside as Petrobank has been drifting lower.

Although the trade looks like a dud, if you had actually hedged out the PBN, it has been a steady performer.  This is due to the fact that PBN has continued to melt lower, with very little signs of life.

This has caused the “stub” value to chug higher.  This morning the stub traded at all time highs since the announcement.

I still think the stub is cheap.  The PBN has been hit with a double whammy of a poor stock market and the heaviness of the PBG spin out supply.  When these two factors ease, PBN should have a decent pop higher.

Although the market gods would not approve, I am adding to the trade even though I am offside.  I am buying more PBG outright and adding a little bit of a hedged long PBG/short PBN position.
