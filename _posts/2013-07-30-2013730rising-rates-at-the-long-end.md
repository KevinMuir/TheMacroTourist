In the past all bull markets were stopped by rising interest rates.  The typical cycle consisted of the stock market rising as the economy improved, with long rates rising as inflationary pressures built up.  Eventually the Federal Reserve would invert the curve, raising short rates above long rates, choking off credit and causing the economy and the stock market to roll over.

However, as our economies have become more and more indebted, there has been less and less of a rise in interest rates required to slow down the economy.  The levels that the Federal Reserve have had to raise rates to slow down the economy in the past few decades have steadily been lower and lower:

The economy has become more sensitive to interest rate changes.

<span style="line-height: 1.6em">Today I have no doubt that the economy will not be able to withstand much of an interest rate rise before rolling over again as total debt outstanding has increased since the last cycle.   </span>

However at the forefront of my concerns is if the Federal Reserve will even be able to raise rates at all, or if the mere increase of the long end of the curve will be enough to choke off economic growth.

The recent bond market rout has made mincemeat of the mortgage market.  Although the short end of the curve has remained fairly stable, the long end was smashed.  This has dramatically affected individuals&#8217; ability to lock in cheap long term mortgage financing.

Have a look at this chart:

The monthly payment on 30 year fixed homes has risen to a level that is higher than any point since the 2008 crisis.

My concern is that given the massive indebtedness, we won&#8217;t need the Federal Reserve to raise rates for the economy to roll over, but simply the natural rise in long term rates will be enough to slow down the economy.

Also, given Wall Street&#8217;s recent infatuation with buying single family homes to rent out, I have no doubt that there is very little chance that this will prove the start of the next bull market in housing.  I subscribe to the Don Coxe theory that once a bubble bursts, it takes decades for it to regain its former glory.  Therefore, I am extremely cautious on US housing, and by extension given its importance to the US economy, I am becoming more and more concerned that we might be due for a hiccup.

Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, I understand the positives.  I am fully aware that if the US economy can somehow reach &#8216;escape velocity&#8217; and actually have the money velocity start to grow, the results could be explosive growth to the upside.  The monetary fuel for the fire is there.

However at this point I feel that the market has priced in a certain degree of optimism that this smouldering ember will light the fire.  I would rather sit back and wait for the flames to show up before I join in on this optimism.
