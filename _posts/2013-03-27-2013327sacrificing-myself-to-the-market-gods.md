As I mentioned yesterday, I am long term bearish on the Japanese Yen.  I had traded from the short side for the first few months of the move, but then I got cute and tried to time lifting the position to catch a small move the other way.  As you would expect, the Market Gods punished me for my sin and I was never really onside in any meaningful way as the Yen decline just continued without me.

Well, I am going to throw myself into the volcano and sacrifice myself to the MGs (Market Gods) by starting to re-establish a Yen short position.

I remember when I used to be an index trader at a major Canadian bank and we had a big position that was going against us hard.  We tried to sacrifice a part of the position in an attempt to make the top/bottom.  Inevitability the turn would not come until we had covered the final portion of our position.  The Market Gods know when you are offside and wait until the point of maximum pain before allowing the market to correct.

Although I am not long Yen, by not being short, given my long term bearish view, I actually feel long.  And just so you know,  I am not putting on the full short position yet, so the correction is probably still be ahead of us.  I will let you know when I am &#8216;all in&#8217; so that you can jump aboard the inevitable Yen rally.
