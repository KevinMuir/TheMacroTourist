In the coming weeks, if we don&#8217;t see a meaningful uptick in the macro data, there is going to be a lot of chatter about the possibility that Yellen will discontinue or reduce the amount of the taper.

If the stock market also sags at the same time, many market participants will buy on the hope that the Fed will once again swoop in and save the day with more QE. Unfortunately after more than 5 years of various QE programs, the market is becoming more and more conditioned to expect this sort solution.

However, I believe that the Fed **_will not alter their taper schedule absent a severe market disruption._** And by severe, I don&#8217;t mean 100 S&P points.

The Fed is not comfortable with the size of their balance sheet, nor do they think the QE program is being as effective as they would like, and finally, although they would never admit this in public, they understand how their policies are exacerbating the inequality problem. The Fed wants to wind down QE3 and they are not looking for excuses to extend it.  No, in fact it is just the opposite.  They would need a really good excuse to not end it.

Now don&#8217;t get me wrong. This Fed is going to be extremely accommodative for some time to come. I fully expect them to usher in the next wave of ultra easy policies that finally ignites the inflationary bonfire. I just don&#8217;t think that this program will be QE.

So if there are stock market bulls out there that are being extra aggressive because the &#8220;Fed has their back&#8221;, they better turn around and do a double check.

And I get the sense that the stock market bulls are indeed feeling very invincible, and a little too complacent regarding the risks.  My twitter feed is filled with traders buying every dip.  There seems to be very little concern given to the fact that in the big picture, stocks are extremely over extended.  We seem to be in the &#8220;feeling no pain&#8221; stage of the euphoria.

However, what is interesting is that even though the traders seem as bullish as ever, the stock market action does not seem to be nearly as jubilant.  Like the knight in Monty Python&#8217;s famous skit that has limbs cut off, but insists that it is only a flesh wound and wants to keep fighting, the stock market bulls seem to be ignoring the worrying stock market action.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="MontyPythonFeb1314.jpg" alt="MontyPythonFeb1314" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/MontyPythonFeb1314.jpg" width="600" height="330" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s just a flesh wound!</figcaption></figure> 

During the last couple of quarters while the bull was in full swing, the market would often open at its low, and then quietly chug higher all day.  There was very little volatility, and the march upwards was composed and relentless.

Lately, the volatility has picked up.  Although we are getting big moves up and down, the market is much more prone to opening with a gap up and sagging during the day.  We are closing near the lows on a disconcerting number of days.

Although I am always respectful that this bull market has been a complete beast that might not be slayed so easily, I think the market is showing increasing signs of topping out.

Given that I believe the Fed is going to **taper until something breaks,** and that the stock market is mistakenly assuming that Yellen will taper at the first blip downwards, I think the risk reward favours the short side.  Yesterday I pulled the trigger on various short stock index positions.

Although I did not short the Russell 2000, let&#8217;s look at that chart as I think it offers the best example of the headwinds this market is facing.

Remember the [&#8220;most perfect trend line&#8221;](http://http://gfbblogs.azurewebsites.net/blog/2014/01/17/friday-january-17th-2014-jack-lew-is-by-no-means-lecturing-the-rest-of-the-world-about-how-to-run-their-economies/)?  The general stock market selloff at the start of the new year decisively broke that trend line.<figure id="attachment_14291" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-14291" alt="RTYLTFeb1214.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/RTYLTFeb1214.png" width="600" height="342" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RTYLTFeb1214-300x171.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RTYLTFeb1214.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/RTYLTFeb1214.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Russell 2000 index &#8211; the most perfect trend line</figcaption></figure> 

As you would expect, it broke rather hard and continued for some ways downward.  However, with the rally of the last week or so, the Russell 2000 has pushed back upwards, to a point where it has almost touched the trend line from below.

I am no technician, but it also failed right at the 50 day moving average.<figure id="attachment_14281" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-14281" alt="RTYFeb1214.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/RTYFeb1214.png" width="600" height="343" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RTYFeb1214-300x171.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RTYFeb1214.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/RTYFeb1214.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Russell 2000 failed at the 50 day moving average</figcaption></figure> 

I don&#8217;t trade much based on this sort of precise technical analysis, but other people do and it definitely looks like the 50 day average held as resistance.

My analysis technique is much more sympathetic to stepping back and looking at the bigger picture.  And what I see is a market that had a spill from 1180 to 1080, and has now rallied half of that amount back in a text book perfect retracement.  The medium term trend is still down and that rallies should be sold.

I did not short the Russell 2000, but I should have as it was actually the weakest of the indexes.

Yesterday I entered into short positions on three different markets, with one of those indexes being the Nasdaq 100.  The Nasdaq is pushing right back up against the old highs and I realize that I am committing the trader&#8217;s sin of selling the strong one, but I couldn&#8217;t resist.<figure id="attachment_14231" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-14231" alt="NDXFeb1214.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/NDXFeb1214.png" width="600" height="342" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/NDXFeb1214-300x171.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/NDXFeb1214.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/NDXFeb1214.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Nasdaq 100 Index &#8211; right at the highs!</figcaption></figure> 

I think the euphoria regarding the technology stocks is just plain dumb.  I had a look at the weightings of the biggest companies in the US.  In order they are:

  1.  AAPL &#8211; Apple
  2. GOOG &#8211; Google
  3. XOM &#8211; Exxon
  4. MSFT &#8211; Microsoft
  5. BRK/B &#8211; Berkshire Hathaway

Three of the top four biggest companies in the world&#8217;s biggest economy are technology stocks.  We better hope that the future of technology is as rosy as the bulls would have us believe because the stock market hinges on it.

As for the Nasdaq 100 we get the usual suspects, but then we add a  couple of other stupidly expensive stocks with the introduction of Facebook and Amazon.

  1. AAPL &#8211; Apple
  2. GOOG &#8211; Google
  3. MSFT &#8211; Microsoft
  4. VOD &#8211; Vodaphone
  5. AMZN &#8211; Amazon
  6. FB &#8211; Facebook

But you are probably saying to yourself &#8211; AAPL is actually cheap on an earnings basis.  I know how &#8220;cheap&#8221; Apple is.  I know that Carl Ichan, when he isn&#8217;t getting in screaming matches with other hedge fund managers on CNBC, loves the stock.  I know they are about to revolutionize TV and watches.  But this is a big company.  The biggest company in the US.  It takes a long of continued good news to keep it growing.

And as for Apple&#8217;s recent rally on the news that the company had bought $16 billion of their stock back, I find the reaction higher after the announcement amusing.<figure id="attachment_14361" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-14361" alt="AAPLFeb1214.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/AAPLFeb1214.png" width="600" height="384" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AAPLFeb1214-300x192.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AAPLFeb1214.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/AAPLFeb1214.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">AAPL trading after the $16 billion dollar buy back announcement</figcaption></figure> 

It rallied _after they had announced the purchases._  To me that means they had $16 billion less of their stock left to buy.  I am obviously not as sophisticated as the legions of dip buyers that understand what moves AAPL, but I generally like to buy companies whose buy backs are not yet filled &#8211; not those that have already completed their blue tickets.

But hey, I am obviously a &#8220;trade-a-saurus&#8221; who just doesn&#8217;t understand that all news is good news.

Well this dinosaur is standing in there and selling them the Nasdaq 100 that they are all clamouring for.  I will sit through a move to new highs, and fully understand the emotional nature of the trading period we are engulfed in.

Yesterday, I also got nervous about my short Japanese Yen position and instead of lightening up on the trade, I decided to short some Nikkei Futures.  The Nikkei really got blasted at the beginning of the year, but like the Russell, it has rallied back into strong overhead resistance.<figure id="attachment_14261" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-14261" alt="NKYFeb1214.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/NKYFeb1214.png" width="600" height="342" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/NKYFeb1214-300x171.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/NKYFeb1214.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/NKYFeb1214.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Nikkei Index &#8211; rallying back into resistance</figcaption></figure> 

I also believe that many hedge funds are trading the Nikkei from the long side, and as you know, I hate trades that are popular amongst the hedge funds.  Therefore if I can be short something that they are long that is not performing well, I am happy to take the other side of their trade.

And finally, I added to my European Eurostoxx short.  This time I entered the trade on an outright short basis &#8211; no hedging it with long S&P500.<figure id="attachment_14271" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Again, it has rallied up into strong overhead resistance and I think the bigger picture trend is down.
</p>

I am not expecting my timing to be perfect, and I realize that in the short run, I am selling markets that have been headed higher during the past week.  However, I think the stock market is not realizing that the Fed is going to taper until something breaks, and that the risks are increasing.  To me, it feels like the bulls are pushing their luck.

<hr size="2" width="85%" />

**Positions**

**UPDATE:  Short Nasdaq 100 futures, short Eurostoxx futures, and short Nikkei futures.  **I entered the trade on Wednesday with idea that the Fed is going to taper until something breaks and that the bulls are pushing their luck.  Conviction 4.  No stops for now

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index vs Long S&P 500.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities.   **On Friday I turned this into a spread trade by buying S&P 500 futures on the other side.  There is no longer any delta associated with the position and it is purely a relative performance trade.  **Conviction 5

**Short Euro.  **Not much to say, I didn&#8217;t enter this trade very well, but I still think the Euro works it way lower in coming months. Conviction 4

****Short Yen.****  Establish short Yen last week.  Now I will sit tight and wait.  Conviction 4

**Short JGB futures.  **I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
