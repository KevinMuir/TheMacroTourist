I remember a few years back when natural gas began steadily falling yet crude oil was enjoying a tremendous rally, I decided that the mis-pricing could not last forever and I foolishly bought natural gas while shorting crude oil. Even though I managed to escape with most of my fingers, catching that falling knife was a dumb trade. 

The complication that I missed was that although the mis-pricing would most likely eventually be corrected, the amount of natural gas that was being found in the US (and Canada to some degree) through the new fracking technology was truly mind blowingly massive. The sheer size of the natural gas supply expansion meant that the small amount of demand increase that could occur quickly through substitution was not nearly enough to offset the increase in supply. Prices fell. And fell, and fell and fell some more until they finally hit an &#8216;obscene price&#8217; of below $2 in the spring of 2012.

Since then, the natural gas price has bounced, but considering the fact that crude oil is also much higher than it has been in the recent past, the rebound has not been that dramatic.

In fact, the price of crude oil in energy equivalent natural gas units, is pretty well at its highs:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/BOECLNGOct07123.gif" alt="BOECLNGOct07123" title="BOECLNGOct07123.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

There is approximately 6 times the energy in a barrel of crude oil vs natural gas, so if they were priced equally on an energy equivalent basis, either natural gas would be trading at $17 or crude oil would be trading at $22. The chart above is the price of crude oil minus 6 units of nat gas. As you can see, either crude is really expensive, or nat gas is dirt cheap.

At this point you probably see where I am going with this and you are already saying to yourself &#8211; &#8220;yes, natural gas is cheap &#8211; so what? it has been cheap for a long time and given the massive amount of shale gas they are finding, it will stay cheap!&#8221;

Ahhh… you would be correct about the natural gas supply continuing to expand &#8211; there is no doubt in my mind that in the coming years the US will expand its natural gas supply dramatically.

However, I do not believe that this increase in supply will continue to have the same effect on price that it has had in the past. 

During the last supply expansion, the natural gas was land locked in the US. The low prices could not translate into greater demand because natural gas substation takes a long time to implement. If the price of beef rises, then consumers will naturally substitute it with pork or chicken. Or if the opposite occurs and the price of beef declines, they will stop buying as much pork or chicken and buy more beef. However, there is no easy way for consumers (or even governments or companies) to easily substitute other energy for natural gas. 

Substituting means converting your gasoline powered vehicles to natural gas through a lengthy and expensive conversion. Or it means building a natural gas electrical plant instead of a coal or nuclear plant. It is simply not something that happens overnight.

But as the saying goes, the best cure for low prices is low prices. It takes time, but the market works. 

And the best example of that is the arbitrage that is occurring between natural gas from the US versus the rest of the world. Although the US is swimming in natural gas, the same supply expansion has not happened nearly as dramatically everywhere else. Therefore, the price of LNG (liquified natural gas) for many other countries is trading much closer to an energy equivalent basis to crude oil. Have a look at the price of LNG for landing in Japan:

You can see that it is trading at $16, which is much more in line versus crude oil. 

Now you may be asking yourself, how can natural gas be trading at $3.50 in the US and $16 in Japan? The answer is that there currently is no way for the US to ship it over to Japan. They simply do not have the LNG conversion facilities. However, that is changing. Have a look at this table that outlines the new LNG terminals being built:

The US is going to turn into the Saudi Arabia of the natural gas world. The amount of LNG exports is going to be monstrous. According to ZH the above projects amount to 30 billion cubic feet per day which is 43% of current US natural gas production. 

**The big long term picture is that the discount on US natural gas is going to narrow.**

Yes, you could have said this 2 years ago, and I could very well once again be early, but this is a case where sentiment is no longer filled with knife catchers. Instead it is a situation where natural gas has slipped off of everybody&#8217;s radar for being &#8220;too boring&#8221; and endlessly for sale. This is exactly the kind of out of the way investment that I like to make.

Have a look at this long term chart of the net position for speculators in Nat Gas:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/NGSpecNetPosOct0713.gif" alt="NGSpecNetPosOct0713" title="NGSpecNetPosOct0713.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

Since 2007 the speculators (probably mostly hedge funds and other professional traders) have been net short. They really pushed their luck into 2011 and to a large extent they were right. However, I think there is a decent chance that they have over stayed their welcome and that the tide is about to turn.

In the past, the natural gas curve used to trade with a really steep slope. You couldn&#8217;t buy far out months without paying a massive 50% to 100% premium to the spot rate.

Today the curve is much less steep and there is a lot less negative carry for long positions.

It looks like we might be basing above $3.40 and I am going to start to initiate long positions:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/NG1Oct0713.gif" alt="NG1Oct0713" title="NG1Oct0713.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

I am going to buy various months out the curve, but the exact implementation doesn&#8217;t matter. I want to be long nat gas. My guess is that within a few years the price of US natural gas is going to double or triple to come more in line with both foreign priced LNG and crude oil. The surprises will be to the upside going forward.
