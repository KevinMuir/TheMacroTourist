<p class="p1">
  I have been a little remiss in updating this journal over the Christmas holidays. There is a fair amount to discuss, but right now I would like to focus on one particular issue.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I continue to be amazed at how pessimistic most market pundits continue to be regarding the United States&#8217; asset markets.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Don’t get me wrong, over the long run I believe that the US (along with most western countries) face some very serious structural issues that are going to present some significant challenges. However, it seems that Americans in particular, are <strong>especially pessimistic</strong> about their future.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I am not sure if it is a function of the fact that things were so easy for the Americans for so long. Or whether it is a by-product of their increasingly divisive society. But for whatever reason, Americans seem to believe that things will never get better.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  The amount of “the end is near” research pieces that come across my desk is amazing. There are in fact bloggers like ZeroHedge who have managed to make a living forecasting the imminent demise of America.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Do not take this post to mean that I am some sort of “American fan boy”. &nbsp;In fact, I can be quite critical of many of their policies (I am after all, according to most Americans, a ‘socialist’). &nbsp;However the purpose of this journal is not to debate politics, but instead of to take advantage of “what is” instead of “what should be”.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  There is no doubt in my mind that the “what is” analysis should ignore the negative rhetoric and look at the higher probability outcomes.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  The last decade was really bad for America. Between debt financing a couple of wars, engaging in imprudent tax policy and combining it with irresponsible monetary policy, the Americans managed to make a real mess of their economy. That point I will not dispute.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  And since then, things have been far from perfect.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  But let’s examine the changes that have occurred over the last few years.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  The American consumer has continued to de-lever, with the average individual now sporting a much better debt to equity ratio when compared to many other Western consumers (just look at the average Canadian’s debt today if you want to see a problem). The Federal Reserve&#8217;s aggressive Quantitative Easing programs have sent the US dollar much lower, to the point where it is increasingly becoming more efficient for manufacturing to come back to America instead of being expanded overseas (see Lenovo and Apple for just two examples). And finally. the shale revolution has resulted in America having one of the lowest priced energy environments in the developed world.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  At the margin, America is slowly healing itself. These slow moving macro changes <strong>will have an effect</strong> &#8211; they just take a while to show up.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  At the same time, the rest of the world is increasingly getting worse. Europe is a disaster that needs no explanation. The BRICs and other commodity countries have over invested in the commodity super cycle and look increasingly vulnerable to a global slowdown.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  America’s future is far from rosy. But at the margin it is better than the vast majority of other nations.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I for one, am not going to sell the Americans short. I read once that if America raised their gas tax to a level similar to Canada’s, they could eliminate their deficit almost overnight. Now that might have been before their deficit had gotten so out of control, but the US has an amazing earning power that should not be underestimated.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  This wound from the 2008 credit crisis might be much deeper than any of the slowdowns of the last 80 years, but I am not ready to simply write off the Americans.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  The pessimism that is prevailing amongst the American public reminds me of a time when I first started trading. I think I was 18 years old (maybe even younger) and I had saved some money to open a futures account. My father had co-signed the account &#8211; giving the broker strict instructions to not let me lose anymore than I had (he fully expected it to be gone quickly &#8211; a prediction that proved remarkably accurate). I met my broker and the first question out of his mouth was &#8211; “you’re not opening a futures account to short the Canadian dollar, are you?”
</p>

<p class="p1">
  “No,” I lied, ”of course not&#8221;. I did indeed want to short the Canadian dollar as I ‘knew’ what a disaster Canada actually was…
</p>

<p class="p1">
  “I am so fed up of everybody opening futures accounts to short Canadian dollars. They keep losing and losing…” my broker said.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  At the time Canada was suffering from many of the same problems that the US is currently experiencing. The Canadian government had spent too much, gotten themselves into a real mess and the pain from correcting the excesses made the economy seem really bleak.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  However, eventually the market started to ‘sniff out’ the recovery. Many Canadians didn’t believe it, and shorting Canadian dollar futures seemed to be a popular trade amongst the hockey loving nation.&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="p1">
  It turned out that this pessimism regarding the Canadian economy was a result of looking too closely and missing the big picture. &nbsp;The right trade was to ignore the negative rhetoric and to realize that Canada had turned the corner.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  America very well might be in the midst of a similar moment. The US investors themselves don’t believe in this rally because it ‘feels’ so bad economically.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  The pessimistic ‘gloom and doom’ argument is very persuasive. It does not take much imagination to list all of the troubles that America is facing. But that doesn’t mean it is the right trade.
</p>

I think that most Americans are still haunted by the 2008 credit crisis, and that they are missing the fact that slowly, their economy is on the mend. Not only that, their economic situation relative to the rest of the world is much better than the average American investor realizes.

Hopefully I have learned my lesson from 25 years ago and I will not be tempted to sell the Americans short&#8230;</p> </p></p>
