On the classic rock FM station here in Toronto, there is an afternoon DJ by the name of Kim Mitchell.  Some of you might recognize his name from the 1980s as he had a couple of small hits and was a pseudo famous Canadian rock star.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/50ec14cfe4b00335962a9f4d/1357649103559/Kim%20Mitchell%20Jan%2008%2013Kim%20Mitchell%20Jan%2008%2013?format=original" />

On his radio show, Kim does a bit called &#8220;Damn! I wish I wrote that!&#8221;  In this segment, he picks a famous rock song, discusses it a little &#8211; he might talk about its history or how he met that particular rock star, then Kim sometimes plays a portion of the song himself on his guitar, and finally right before he lets the track roll, he introduces the song with something like &#8211; &#8220;Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s Born to run &#8211; Damn!  I wish I wrote that!&#8221;

I am going to steal Kim&#8217;s idea and introduce my own version of this concept called &#8220;Damn!  I wish I traded that!&#8221;  I am going to highlight a different trade every month that I didn&#8217;t necessarily trade, but wish I had.

This month&#8217;s trade will be AT&T&#8217;s purchase of Metro Net Communications from the late 1990s.

During the DotCom bubble, one of the hottest sectors was telecommunication stocks.  These companies were the toll takers for the mushrooming internet business and investors could not get enough of them.  Many fortunes were made as smaller more nimble companies carved out new territory.  A small upstart from Calgary called MetroNet had managed to quickly grow their business to the point where it had a $7 billion dollar market capitalization.

AT&T, wanting to quickly expand into Canada, decided to buy MetroNet.

More than a decade has past since this happened, so please excuse me if I get some of the facts wrong.  I might not get the specifics perfect, but I will be able to tell you the story of how this became one of the great risk arbitrage plays of all time.

Although MetroNet shareholders were keen to sell to AT&T, the government still had some changes to make to allow a foreign company to own a Canadian telecommunications company.  The takeover deal was therefore structured to have an extremely long closing (I think it was more than 2 years) to allow for the necessary changes to the Canadian law.  The take out deal price increased at a set percentage every year.  The initial price was something like $60 per share and it rose by $3.50 every year.

So far so good &#8211; MetroNet shareholders sell out to the biggest telecommunications company in the world with a price that ratchets higher as the deal takes longer to close.  Sounds like a risk arbitrageurs dream come true.

For a while it was a great trade that attracted many risk arb funds.  The benefits were obvious &#8211; a great credit buying a company with a long time frame where you could lock in a great yield.

But then the DotCom bubble burst.  And telecommunications stocks were decimated.

Other Canadian telecommunication companies that had not sold to AT&T found their stock prices being halved every six months.  The pain was monstrous and relentless.

MetroNet&#8217;s price did not budge though, as it was trading more like a risk arbitrage play than a telecommunications stock.

However, as the pain from the bubble bursting increased, the risk arbitrageurs could no longer ignore the risks that _maybe AT&T would try to squirm their way out of the deal._

Not only that, but the worry about the deal had caused even the MetroNet bonds, which at this point had traded as though they were AT&T credit, to start to lose value.  The enterprise value of the whole MetroNet takeover was something like $7 billion dollars.  Yet, only $2 billion was stock.  The other $5 billion was an assumption of debt.

If AT&T had not entered into the agreement to buy MetroNet and it was free to trade on its own, then the relative valuation would have probably meant more than a 50% decline in the enterprise value of MetroNet, meaning that the equity would have been wiped out and the bond holders would have taken an haircut.

But AT&T _had_ entered into the agreement, and according to all the risk arbitrageurs, the agreement was rock solid.  What if they were wrong?  What if AT&T found a loop hole?  Usually a deal breaking would not result in a 100% loss.  But in this case, that was exactly what would happen if AT&T found a way out.

Risk arbitrageurs, sensing that the risk was now too large, abandoned the stock in droves.  The deal began trading with a 20+% yield to close.  It was a big liquid deal that was trading like it was going to blow up.

All the while, AT&T kept mum.  They did not comment one way or another, which scared the risk arbs even more.

Into this panic is where the trade reached legendary status.

Even though the downside if they were wrong was a complete wipe out, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs and a couple of other savvy hedge funds loaded up the boat on MetroNet stock.  They had put the takeover agreement through the legal microscope and had determined there was no way AT&T could get out of the trade.  Then, in a move of pure genius, they did the math and decided that even though AT&T was going to spend $2 billion on a piece of equity that was completely worthless, they were not going to follow through and buy the rest of the company.  There was no obligation for AT&T to buy the bonds, the market had just assumed that since they spent so much on the equity, they would follow through on the bonds.  These risk arbitrageurs shorted the bonds in size.

So the risk arbitrageurs did the exact opposite move that most would expect.  Instead of buying the supposedly &#8216;safe&#8217; bonds that were trading at a big discount, they shorted them.  And instead of shorting the supposedly &#8216;risky&#8217; piece of equity that was completely worthless, they bought it.

Although Bear Stearns would eventually blow up trading mortgage derivatives, at this time they were one of the most wily traders on the street.  To me, there is nothing that shows their acumen better than their positioning on this trade.

AT&T eventually bought the equity for the full deal price (resulting in a big win for the arbitrageurs) and at the same time, AT&T walked away from the bonds (again resulting in a big win for the risk arbs who had shorted the bonds).

As I came to learn the details of how this trade played out, I have continued to be in awe of the guts and brains of the traders who nailed this trade.  All I can say is, &#8220;AT&T&#8217;s purchase of MetroNet &#8211; Damn!  I wish I had traded it like that!&#8221;
