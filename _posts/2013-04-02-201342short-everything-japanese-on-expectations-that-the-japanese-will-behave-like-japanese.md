Last year we had a running joke on the desk about the best time to buy Yen.  Our joke was not that funny, but it does serve to make a point about our mindset at the time.  It went something like this &#8211; &#8220;what are the best hours to buy Yen?&#8221;  Answer &#8211; &#8220;the hours where the market is open.&#8221;

If you recall back to last year, even though the writing on the wall was obvious for everyone to see, the Yen kept rallying day after day.  I would pull up charts of EuroYen and gasp in exasperation at how there was no way that this could continue because it wouldn&#8217;t be long before Toyota and the rest of Japanese industry would be bankrupt at the expense of Volkwagen and the other European companies that were benefitting from at a currency that was almost half of its value versus the Yen from a couple of years ago.

The Japanese situation was incredibly perverse.  Their economy was suffering from a massive contractionary collapse brought on by the slowing global economy and made all the worse with the Japanese earthquake/tsunami/nuclear disaster.  The sudden slowdown caused a destruction in Yen credit, which ultimately caused the supply of Yen to shrink, which forced the Yen higher.   However, given their economic situation, the rise in the Yen was completely unsustainable, and the longer it stayed high without the Japanese authorities intervening, the bigger ultimate adjustment would be needed.

It created a weird boom bust cycle brought on by a rising Yen that was not aggressively stymied aggressively enough.

As we all know, in the fall, a new Japanese government was elected on a platform of arresting this Yen rise and stopping deflation.  Since then, the markets have made the new government&#8217;s job quite easy as the Yen has fallen significantly all the while the Nikkei has risen along with the JGB market.  It has been a shockingly easy process.

I wrote about how this process was too easy.  I expected the market to force the Japanese government to deliver.

I am becoming increasingly concerned that the Japanese government does not understand what is required and their next move will be a disappointment.  Japanese governments have a long history of promising everything and delivering basically nothing.  The markets have long been frustrated by the Japanese inability to follow through.  It was only a year ago that a favourite hedge fund trade would be to buy Yen from the Bank of Japan when they intervened.  The BoJ would often wander into the foreign exchange market, sell a little Yen and walk away.  There was no fear that they would do whatever it took to achieve their goal of a lower Yen.

For a while it seemed that the new Prime Minister Abe understood this.  His rhetoric seemed to include comments about &#8216;whatever it takes.&#8217;  However, his latest comments seem to be very &#8216;Japanese&#8217; like as opposed to Swiss National Bank &#8216;we will sell unlimited Francs to defend the peg&#8217; like.

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">
    <strong>*ABE SAYS CURRENCY CORRECTION HELPING EXPORTERS COMPETITIVENESS </strong>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    <strong></strong><strong>*ABE SAYS IT&#8217;S POSSIBLE BOJ WILL FAIL TO REACH INFLATION TARGET </strong>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    <strong>*ABE SAYS ECONOMY SUBJECT TO UNFORSEEN CIRCUMSTANCES </strong>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    <strong>*ABE SAYS BOJ MUST EXPLAIN IF IT FAILS TO REACH INFLATION TARGET </strong>
  </li>
</ul>

These comments almost seem to be setting up the whole process for failure.

I am wondering if Abe has realized that this is going to be more difficult than he foresaw and that the market has &#8216;priced in&#8217; too much near term success.

I am going to cover my outright short Yen that I dabbled in yesterday.

However I am going to keep my short Nikkei USD futures that are combined with short JPY currency futures.  And I am going to keep my massive short JGB bet on.

In fact, I like this trade as a short everything Japanese basket and will add a little.

This week the BoJ meets for the first time, and I believe they are going to disappoint.  This is my way of setting up for that scenario.
