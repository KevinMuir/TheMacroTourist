I was having a discussion with my wife&#8217;s 100 year Grandmother the other day (I am not making that up &#8211; she is really 100 years oldâ€¦ On her birthday, she got a letter from the Queen and the Prime Minister. The PM looked like he even signed it for real himself.) Anyways, as I was saying I was having a discussion with my wife&#8217;s Grandmother and as she is somewhat of a fan of the Macro Tourist, we love to talk markets. She said she was worried about my short positions as she explained to me that the Federal Reserve is engaging in Quantitative Easing and everyone knows that this is bullish for risk assets.

(Not my Great Grandmother in-law &#8211; I just really like the picture)

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/100YearSOct0113.jpeg" alt="100YearSOct0113" title="100YearSOct0113.jpeg" border="0" width="518" height="600" />

Then on the way home from her birthday party, I ran into the Shell gas station near my house to buy a diet coke where I got into a lively exchange with the counter clerk who was busy buying out of the money call options on Tesla and Facebook. He told me it was a &#8220;can&#8217;t lose&#8221; trade as the Fed did not taper at the recent meeting.

Finally, when I walked into our house, I noticed that the computer was on and opened to my Quest Trade account. Molly, our Newfoundland dog, had been busy buying some LinkedIn and Netflix in my RSP as she was concerned that my portfolio was too heavily skewed towards cash. She woofed at me that I needed to get some &#8220;juice&#8221; in that account because Ben is going to print forever.

Between my wife&#8217;s 100 year Grandmother, the Shell gas station clerk and my dog, I think it is safe to assume that everyone now &#8220;knows&#8221; that you need to buy risk assets (and the riskier the better) because of the Fed&#8217;s policies.

It is not like this concept is new to me. I have argued for quite some time that the Federal Reserve was directly affecting stock prices. We even created a big study (which we have updated) to show how on the days where the Fed did their POMO (permanent open market operations), it caused the stock market to outperform relative to the size of the purchase.

**However, I am also a believer that when everyone &#8220;knows&#8221; something, then no one &#8220;knows&#8221; anything.** The idea that you have some sort of edge because you understand that the Fed is engaging in QE is flabbergasting to me. 

The Fed is indeed tricking everyone out the risk curve, and the only question is where we are in this process. My dog buying LinkedIn and Netfix was the last straw for me, and although I warn you that _I am always early_, I think we are approaching the end. 

We have hit a point where the trade is being put on regardless of price. There is no reasoning like, &#8220;the Fed is stimulating, stocks are inexpensive relative to bonds and I can find value by venturing out the risk curve.&#8221; 

Instead it is more like &#8220;the Fed is going to print forever and there is no where to go but stocks &#8211; BUY! BUY! BUY!&#8221;

Whenever you hit a point in the market cycle where everyone has accepted something as a &#8220;can&#8217;t lose&#8221; and the prevailing attitude becomes such that people feel confident in telling you that you are an idiot for suggesting otherwise, you know it is a scary point. I remember discussing my short position in bonds with some buddies a year ago. At the time, they told me that there was no inflation anywhere and I was a fool for shorting them. Today, they are selling their bonds (20% lower) to buy stocks. It was hard then being short bonds, and it is hard today being short stocks.

As for our study about the effects of POMO on the stock market. We had measured the Close to Close return, along with the Open to Close return on the various days of different size POMOs.

For the period from January 2013 to July 2013, here are the returns for the Open to Close for the different size POMOs (note the brackets indicate negative returns):

No POMO &#8211; return (1.72%)
  
Small POMO &#8211; return (0.13%)
  
Medium POMO &#8211; return (0.14%)
  
Big POMO &#8211; return (0.22%)
  
Biggest POMO &#8211; return (0.04%)

You can see that the Biggest POMO days dramatically outperformed all other days by a wide margin. So you can see that my wife&#8217;s Great Grandmother is indeed correct &#8211; Ben has been affecting the markets by a great deal.

However, what about the last couple of months?

The data is a little more choppy as there are a lot less points, but the effect does not seem as pronounced:

No POMO &#8211; August return (0.16%) September return +1.20% (only one no-POMO day)
  
Small POMO &#8211; August return +0.05% September return 0.00%
  
Medium POMO &#8211; August return +0.05% September return (0.24%)
  
Biggest POMO &#8211; August return (0.31%) September return (0.17%)

**The important part of this data is that in both months, the larger POMOs resulted in a more negative return.**

Could it be that the market has begun to fully price in the POMOs? Given the wide scale press and research coverage of the QE program, I think this is an increasingly likely scenario.

What will happen to the market when either the Fed does taper (although the Shell clerk thinks that won&#8217;t be any time soon), or the market hits a point of having fully discounted the QE?

I am not sure, but I don&#8217;t think it is going to be good.

My Great Grandmother In-law says that I worry too much and that I should have some fun. That&#8217;s easy for her to say, she&#8217;s being long TSLA for 150 points.
