Last year as it became increasingly evident that Prime Minister Abe was going to win and more importantly, follow through on his bold economic platforms, the price of gold in Japan started to rise.  In an environment of an extremely accommodative policy this made perfect sense and it was not at all unexpected.  This trade quickly became a hedge fund favourite as a way to capitalize on the changing Japanese poicy.  I distinctly remember the &#8216;legendary&#8217; Dennis Gartman pounding the table recommending buying gold in terms of Yen (for US investors that would mean buying gold and selling Yen in equal dollar terms).  It was a great trade and until a week ago, everyone was on side as it hit new highs:

It took less than a week for everyone in this trade to be completely wiped out.  The crash from the last couple of days has made it so now we are trading at prices where no one is on side:

Which brings me to the next most popular hedge fund trade&#8230;  Buying Japanese stocks and hedging the currency by shorting Yen.

Now, maybe I am wrong, maybe the &#8216;buying gold in Yen&#8217; trade has nothing in common with the &#8216;buying Japanese stocks and hedging the currency&#8217; trade.  Maybe there is real economic wealth being created in Japan and it makes sense for gold in Yen terms to give up all of its gains in 3 trading sessions while Japanese stocks stay perched at these lofty levels:

However, this morning I read an article that demand for physical gold in Japan has skyrocketed over the last couple of days.  The Japanese public is at least doing the trade in the right order (buying after it goes down, not the other way round).  I also read that the Japanese public are actually selling stocks into the rally.  It is the foreigners that are aggressively buying the Japanese stocks.

Maybe these hedge funds will get the Japanese stock trade right.  Maybe that one will pay for all their &#8216;gold in Yen&#8217; losses.

But I for one am going to go with the Japanese public on this one.  I love the trade of buying gold in Yen terms and selling Japanese stocks&#8230;
