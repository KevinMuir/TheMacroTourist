We all remember the famous Seinfeld episode where George decides that since everything he does turns out badly, he should just do the opposite:

> “if every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right”

Putting his theory to work, he decides to ask out a woman that he sees at the cafe:

> &#8220;My name is George. I&#8217;m unemployed and I live with my parents.&#8221;

To his great surprise she says yes.

To speculate successfully in the market, you need to be a little bit like George.

> &#8220;If everybody knows something, then no one knows anything&#8221; &#8211; old Wall Street saying

This morning the market has been bombarded with more confirmation that the US employment situation is indeed improving.  The Initial Jobless Claims came in at an unexpected 320k, which was 15k lower than economists predicted.

The bond market has been crushed, with yields breaking out to new highs everywhere:

The chatter amongst market participants is all about how this will accelerate the Fed&#8217;s tapering.  They are instinctively selling bonds.

I contend that if the Fed does taper, there is a good chance that it will be a policy mistake.   The economy is not ready to stand on its own feet.  The removal of stimulus will most likely usher in another wave of asset deflation.

As illogical as it seems, I think the trade right now is to buy bonds and short stocks.  I will expand on this in future posts, but for now, I am going to pull a George on this one.
