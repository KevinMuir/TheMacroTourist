Next week the MacroTourist is headed off on vacation with the family. There will be no updates until March 24th. 

I am still deciding what to do with many of my positions, but I will most likely be dramatically reducing my risk so that I can have a &#8220;relatively&#8221; stress free vacation.

I have been lucky enough to have had a decent little run of late, so I don&#8217;t want to give back too much while I am not paying attention.

Therefore this morning, I am going to cover all of my Nasdaq and Eurostoxx equity shorts. I will also reduce risk in most of my other trades.

There are a lot of worries about Putin&#8217;s intentions in Ukraine which is weighing heavily on the market. Although anything can happen, continuing to bet on this crisis escalating from here is probably not the right bet. I wouldn&#8217;t want to be long, but given that I am good and short, it is time to bring some in. 

And since I won&#8217;t be writing next week, I would just like to take this opportunity to wish everyone a Happy St. Patrick&#8217;s day in advance. Last year the MacroTourist took a month off travelling in the UK with the family. We tacked on a week in Ireland just because we felt that we really &#8220;should&#8221; visit Ireland while we were there. Too many people had warned us that it would be a waste of a week, but it proved to be the highlight of our trip. I have never met such a warm caring pleasant bunch of people. Everywhere we went people were so kind and enjoyable. Although it did indeed rain much too much, the Irish will forever have a special place in my heart. Happy St. Patrick&#8217;s day!

**Positions**

The Macrotourist is headed off on vacation for a week and will be dramatically reducing risk. The portfolio will be changed when I return on March 24th.

**UPDATE: COVERING Short Nasdaq 100 futures and short Eurostoxx futures** Fed is going to taper until something breaks.  Conviction 3.  No stops for now

**Update: Short European stocks via ESTX50 index vs Long S&P 500.** Covering half of this trade into the recent dip. I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities.   Conviction 2

**Short CAD.** Will add through 1.12. Stop 1.09. Conviction 2

**Buy TIPS short TLT spread through long dated options.** Conviction 3

**Short 10 Year US Treasury Futures with half of position married to out of the money calls** Conviction 6

**Short US 5 Year Treasury Futures.** I expect the Fed to continue to withdraw stimulus aggressively.   Conviction 3

**Short US 2 Year Treasury Futures.** I think the downside is a move from 31 bps to 25 while the upside is a move up to 50 bps.  Conviction 4

**Short Mar and June 2016 Eurodollar vs long equivalent BAX futures.** Conviction 3

**Long March 2014 VIX Futures.** Conviction 2. 

**Long a tiny position of puts on TSLA and FB.** Just for shits and giggles. Conviction 1. Stop &#8211; none: when they go to zero the market will do it for me.

**Short Yen.**   Conviction 3

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 1. No stop.

**Long Yen volatility.** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  Conviction: 3

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.**  Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.**  I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 4. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 4. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.**  Conviction level:5. No stop period.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.**  See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.**  I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
