Today is an extremely interesting day.  Although I am on the wrong side of many of the moves, I am trying to stay objective and not anticipate price, but merely react.

One of the markets that I am following closely is the US treasury bond market.  As the global economy has been slowing over the last couple of months, US Treasury yields have worked their way lower:

Although in the long run I am extremely bearish on the bond market, a month ago as I noticed the economic data was turning softer, I side stepped out of my short T bond position.  Since then I have erred on trading it from the long side, but only gingerly as I think eventually the Treasury market is going to have a sell off that makes the recent gold sell off look like child&#8217;s play.

This morning the bonds opened up at new low yields, which signified a break upward in price.  It was strange that the market opened so firm because stocks were already rallying pretty significantly over in Europe.  However bond markets throughout the world were well bid this morning, which was enough to push the US treasuries out of the recent range.

As the world stock markets have continued their rallies, the bonds have given up all their gains and have actually turned lower for the day.  Have a look at the intra day chart of the US 10 year yield:

The break to new lows was firmly rejected and we have now slipped back into the previous range.

Although I do not rely on technicals, one of the signals that I love is a failed signal.  In this case, the sign that the breakout could not gather any steam means the buyers are exhausted.

I have re-shorted some of the US Treasury bond position, using the highs of today as a closing stop.
