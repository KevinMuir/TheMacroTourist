In my previous post I speculated about whether we had entered a period of rising (or at least no longer falling) money velocity and whether the monetary fuel from the past 5 years would finally be ignited. &nbsp;In the post I outlined my theory that if the tide had turned, then there would be an increase in bond issuance.

Therefore I note with considerable interest that the largest Payment-in-Kind bond in the history of finance was recently floated by German family owned car component company Schaeffler&#8217;s. &nbsp;The&nbsp;€1.6 billion issue was quickly sopped up by yield hungry investors who didn&#8217;t seem concerned by the poor covenant protection. &nbsp;The fact that the interest could be paid by more bonds didn&#8217;t seem to set off any alarm bells. &nbsp;Nor did the fact that this was the largest deal of its kind&#8230; ever&#8230; &nbsp;

This surely has to scare even the most dovish Central Banker. &nbsp;And what is even more concerning is &#8211; what if it trades well and encourages more companies to refinance?

And I am not the only one noticing this worrisome trend. &nbsp;The Reformed Broker recently quoted a Bloomberg article:&nbsp;

> The market for so-called covenant-light loans that lack typical lender safeguards such as limits on debt has already soared to $155 billion this year, beating the record $96.6 billion in 2007, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary and Data.

I don&#8217;t have an actionable trade to recommend from this data. &nbsp;I have no idea where we are within this credit cycle. &nbsp;It very well could be just the start of these types of refinancings &#8211; as I explained, there is an awful lot of monetary fuel to keep this fire lit. &nbsp;However, at the same time if the public gets scared off by the withdrawal of stimulus, and returns to their debt reducing ways, then this will quickly be snuffed out. &nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em">&nbsp;</span>

What is clear is that there can be no denying that companies are starting to take advantage of yield reaching investors&#8230; &nbsp;&nbsp;
