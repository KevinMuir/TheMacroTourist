I am a little puzzled by the absolute hysteria that the financial pundits have worked themselves into regarding the recent back up in Japanese interest rates.

The first question I would like to ask them is; when Prime Minister Abe pledged to break the back of deflation and achieve 2% inflation, what exactly did you think rates were going to do if he was successful?  Stay at 12.5 basis points for the 5 year or 55 basis points for the 10 year?  The financial press should be celebrating the recent back up in Japanese rates because it signifies that Abe&#8217;s programs are working.

Then the next question I would like to ask them is; how fair is it to describe a move from 55 basis points in the 10 year JGB yield to 90 basis points as an increase of over 80% in rates.  Do they really think that a move from 55 bps to 90 bps is the same as 5.50% to 9.00%?  Their stupidity of describing the recent move in this fashion is astounding.

These financial pundits and hedge funds who are out predicting the end of the world because of a little JGB volatility are chicken littles.  Yes, the JGB decline might one day be a problem, but it is not today.

I think these scare mongers have failed to take a step back and widen out the time frame of their charts.

Here is the JGB 5 Year Yield: over the last few months:

Pretty scary right?  No wonder these hedge funds are freaking out.

Nope!

Let&#8217;s rewind a little.  Let&#8217;s have a look at this rate over the last few decades:

The recent move up is barely a blip.

The rate that the hedge funds and other pundits should have been freaking out about was the absolutely insane move down to 12.5 basis points, not the beginning of the normalization back to proper levels.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; in the long run the Japanese economy is screwed.  Also, don&#8217;t forget that short JGBs is probably my biggest position right now.

However, there is not some imminent disaster lurking because rates in Japan are backing up.  This is fully to be expected.  Remember, if QE is successful, it causes inflation, which causes bonds to go down.

Someday this very well might be a problem &#8211; it just isn&#8217;t today.
