Yesterday I wrote about how I was going to wait until today to make a decision about whether I should cover my short stock position. Going into this morning, that call was looking like pure genius &#8211; but as usual the market Gods are always there ready to make my positions look foolish at a moment&#8217;s notice.

I had thought that the tendency of the market to close weak into month end would cause the sell off we saw yesterday to continue. And in fact, with last night&#8217;s after hours massive spike higher and then complete collapse in Facebook, I was looking quite good.

This morning the market sold off and made new lows for the last couple of days:

However, those lows were soundly rejected and we are now pushing back up into this morning&#8217;s highs.

Given that I think tomorrow has a decent chance of having the beginning of month phenomenon kick in, I am going to start flattening my shorts. Maybe we sell off later in the day, but this market is extremely frothy and trying to stay short is a difficult task. I am by no means advocating a long position, I am simply crying Uncle on my shorts and thinking that I should get out before it really starts to hurt. Not covering two days ago was still the right call, but I would have really preferred to be buying this morning&#8217;s weakness instead of chasing the mid day rally higher. 

I am going to live to fight another day and head to the sidelines on my outright short stocks. For those with a bearish bent, my giving up on the trade is probably the greatest signal out there that is going to start to work.
