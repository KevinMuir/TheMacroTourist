I knew that my long BBRY call was an outlier position, but I had no idea how lonely it would be. After posting my theory of why BBRY was a good risk reward long, even my old man called me up to say that most of my points were wrong and that the only one he could give any credence to was that Prem Watsa is a serious man who does not bid lightly. Not since Michael Dell told Steve Jobs that he should shut down Apple and return the little remaining funds to shareholders has there been a tech company whose demise has been so assured by the investing public.

I am shocked at how many of my hedge fund buddies are completely convinced that there is simply no way that Blackberry can survive.

I am not the only one who is surprised as Prem Watsa was also taken aback by the negative sentiment surrounding his bid and the fortunes of Blackberry. This week-end he reached out and gave an interview to the Globe & Mail:

> “If you read the press and you read these analysts, it looks like [BlackBerry] is going bankrupt. And five years ago it looked like RIM controlled the world. And both views are wrong. It wasn’t one, we found out, and we’re suggesting to you with humility that the second one is wrong.“
> 
> Mr. Watsa claims BlackBerry’s customers are jittery because its fate is uncertain, but will feel more confident and start buying more once the deal is done.
> 
> “What we’re doing here is simply doing our due diligence to figure out what’s needed to finance it over the long term, and then raising the money to have a capital structure that will help the company over the long term,” Mr. Watsa says, adding that the company won’t have too much debt.

> “We want BlackBerry to survive for a long time,” he says. “Which means that it needs to have a very sound capital structure, and we’re going to focus on making sure that that takes place.”

I have a friend who used to run an index arbitrage desk. He was a little bit of an &#8220;the world is coming to an end&#8221; guy which was a great attitude to have as a manager that was forced to counter balance over aggressive traders. However when he stepped down as the manager and took a role managing money for a hedge fund, this bias turned into a liability for the strategy he chose to trade. He was running a risk arbitrage book and although he conducted very thorough research, he was always figuring out ways that the acquiring company could wiggle out of announced deals. Therefore he was always going &#8216;backwards&#8217; (shorting the target stock) because all he could do was imagine different ways the deal could fall apart.

Right now the market is behaving like my old pal and can only see all the different ways that Prem&#8217;s bid will fail.

I used to tell him that although at times the market definitely possessed an over confidence of deals being completed, it was a very difficult strategy to capitalize on because it is human nature that once a deal is announced for it to be completed. There are simply too many vested interests that are pushing for the deal to close. Whether it is the investment bankers who are going to earn fees, or the seller who wants to cash out, or the buyer who wants to follow through on his stated intention &#8211; it takes a lot of negative news to derail a deal.

Therefore it is important to remember that even though Prem has plenty of room to wiggle out of this deal, there is nothing indicating he wants to.

The hedge funds all believe that the deal will not close because Blackberry is such a terrible company. Don&#8217;t forget that Prem sits on the board of Blackberry. Do the hedge funds really believe that he doesn&#8217;t understand Blackberry&#8217;s problems?

I am not going to rehash my long argument, but I will say that this week-end&#8217;s article by Prem has only solidified my belief that he is good for the $9 bid.

I continue to take the other side of the market&#8217;s pessimism regarding this deal and I fully expect another call from my old man telling me I am wrong…
