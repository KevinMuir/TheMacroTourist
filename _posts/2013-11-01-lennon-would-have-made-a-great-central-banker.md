Over the last few days, some much better than expected US economic news has been hitting the tape, which has caused the market to focus on an increasing chance of a December taper. 

This has caused the US dollar to rally:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/USDNov0113.gif" alt="USDNov0113" title="USDNov0113.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

At the margin it has also caused the stock and bond market to get a little &#8220;heavy&#8221;.

Although I understand the market is a discounting mechanism I wonder if participants might be getting a little too focused on the certainty of a taper. 

We all know about the reasons to taper &#8211; markets are getting frothy, QE should be an emergency measure, it is not really helping, it is causing inequality, etc, etc&#8230; We even have the titans of finance publicly chastising the Fed for not already having done it:

> * FINK SAYS IT&#8217;S &#8220;IMPERATIVE&#8221; THAT THE FED BEGIN TO TAPER
> 
> * FINK CALLS MARKET \`OVER-ZEALOUS&#8217; 
> 
> * FINK SAYS THERE ARE &#8220;REAL BUBBLE-LIKE MARKETS AGAIN&#8221;

> Gross: All risk asset prices artificially high. 

Fink and Gross are the two largest bond managers in the world, so when they are talking you can bet that the Fed is at least listening to their opinion.

However the fact that they are calling the Fed out in such a public forum might mean that they have already expressed their concern privately to the Fed and it is has been ignored. These are smart men and they don&#8217;t just shoot their mouth off emotionally like Jim Cramer. 

The question to ask is then _why are they drawing attention to the bubble like markets?_ The reason is that if you look at the traditional criteria that the Fed uses to decide the level of monetary stimulus, the indicators are actually heading the _wrong way for those that are wanting to taper._

The CPI, which the Fed has a 2% target is running at 1.2%:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/CPIYoYNov0113.gif" alt="CPIYoYNov0113" title="CPIYoYNov0113.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

Although it does hop around a lot, there is no sign of the CPI ticking up.

In fact, if you look at commodities there is a good chance that CPI will actually continue to fall. Here is the CRB index:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/CRYNov0113.gif" alt="CRYNov0113" title="CRYNov0113.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

The last three months have seen a 7% decline in the CRB index. This is hardly the stuff that causes the CPI to rise.

The market is equally sanguine about inflation, with the 2 year US break even rate predicting a sub 1.10% rate:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/US2YrBENov0113.gif" alt="US2YrBENov0113" title="US2YrBENov0113.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

Not only that &#8211; over the last month it has been falling! 

Nor is it only a short term phenomenon &#8211; have a look at the 5 year break even rate:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/US5YrBENov0113.gif" alt="US5YrBENov0113" title="US5YrBENov0113.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

It too is below the Fed&#8217;s 2% mandate. And it too is falling.

So from the Fed&#8217;s point of view, there is pretty well zero to worry about in terms of inflation. In fact, if anything there is probably a concern that in this heavily indebted economy, inflation is not running high enough!

And then when you look at the other part of the Fed&#8217;s mandate &#8211; economic growth (which they have decided means employment) &#8211; there is a frustrating slow improvement. Have a look at the unemployment rate over the last couple of decades:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/USUNempNov0113.gif" alt="USUNempNov0113" title="USUNempNov0113.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

You can see that although it has definitely improved from the depths of the 2008 crisis, it is _still a long way from the trend of the 1990s and 2000s._ The Fed has consistently said that the employment picture is on the right track, but it is not improving nearly fast enough. The recent uptick is still a long way from what they are looking for before they ease up on the gas pedal.

When you stand back and look at the economy from the Fed&#8217;s perspective, you realize that inflation is far from a problem and the economy is still not growing nearly as fast as they like. Therefore they might not be happy with the frothiness in the stock and credit markets, but to a certain extent, this is a necessary evil in the goal of stimulating the economy throughout monetary means. There is certainly an argument to be made that the Fed is in no rush to taper.

But hey, you might argue there are more than a few Fed Governors that are getting nervous about the size of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet. They are looking for any excuse they can find to start the tapering, and the latest uptick in the economic numbers might be just the ticket.

Fine, I can buy that argument. The QE program was suppose to be an &#8220;emergency&#8221; program, so any excuse to ease up might be embraced (although they had that excuse last month and they passed). Let&#8217;s assume they will grab hold of the taper window and fix what so many Wall Street portfolio managers were mad at them for passing at last month.

Let&#8217;s assume that they taper at the first opportunity. They have already issued the POMO schedule for all of November, so they are not going to backtrack on their published intentions to buy for this month. The earliest they could cut back is for their December purchases.

Then, let&#8217;s think about what a taper actually means. At the end of QE1 and QE2, they stopped buying securities **full stop.** This caused the financial markets to immediately return to their post 2008 de-levering mode. This time, the Federal Reserve is not suggesting that they go all cold turkey John Lennon style (which by the way was the first song written by John that was credited to Lennon as opposed to Lennon-McCartney). 

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/ColdTurkeyNov0113.jpg" alt="ColdTurkeyNov0113" title="ColdTurkeyNov0113.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="600" />

Although John & Yoko only had a brief experimentation with heroin, the Federal Reserve tried it out the financial equivalent in 2008 and decided that it was too good to give up (even though they tried a couple of times).

The last week has seen the market get all worried about the taper. Let&#8217;s just stop and think about this for a moment. They are not worried that the Fed is going to stop. No, they are worried the rate at which the Fed is buying securities is merely going to slow. That is absolute madness.

Remember the Y2K scare where Easy Al Greenspan &#8220;flooded&#8221; the system with money and caused the Nascrack to go absolutely bezerk? Well, I have highlighted it with a red circle on this chart of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s balance sheet:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/FARBASTNov0113.gif" alt="FARBASTNov0113" title="FARBASTNov0113.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

Easy Al looks like a complete odd lotter compared to helicopter Ben. Now I understand things are different than in 1999. I am merely outlining the massive amount of monetary fuel that has been applied. 

The Federal Reserve is not sitting back after expanding by $85 billion a month over the last 6 months and saying, &#8220;let&#8217;s see if that works.&#8221; No, they are saying we are going to keep expanding, but merely cut back at the rate we are expanding by $5 or $10 billion per month.

The fact that the market is worried about this small withdrawal in the rate of increase is downright insane. 

One of these days, this monetary fuel is going to light, and the Nascrack rally from 2500 to 4500 in the space of 6 months that Greenspan fuelled with his 1999 monetary panic is going to look like child&#8217;s play. 

Back to this week&#8217;s market worry about the taper. When thinking about the possibility of a taper, we have not even discussed the fact that Yellen is not yet confirmed and that this process is going to be messy and time consuming. Will the Fed want to taper in the midst of a transition of the Chairmanship? If the facts for a taper were obvious then they probably would, but as I have shown it is far from a slam dunk.

The chances of a taper are probably lower than the market is discounting, but even if they do taper, it is irrelevant &#8211; the taper is not a halt, but merely a reduction in the amount of stimulus that is been continually applied. Isn&#8217;t that just like a drug addict to talk about slowing down the amount they use? And how many drug addicts do you know that follow through on their plan?

The Fed probably should have taken a page out of Lennon&#8217;s book and given it up cold turkey before they got addicted. (but they didn&#8217;t, so trade accordingly&#8230;)
