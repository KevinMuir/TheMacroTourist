This is probably a stupid trade, but I am going to try to be a hero. 

I gave up on my Gold Shares ETF a week ago, and although at first it looked like I had panicked at the bottom, the relentless gold bear market quickly skated me onside on my sale.

Since then we have drifted lower and in fact have probed the lows last seen in the summer gold swoon.

I am going to stand in here and put my long back on.

Yes, I know all the reasons that this trade shouldn&#8217;t work. Yes, I realize that only fools buy new lows. But I can&#8217;t resist and you are going to have to put me into the fool camp.

We have all three major Central Banks aggressively stimulating. We have open talk about negative rates. 

I have a theory on what is happening, and it involves the yield curve steepening, but I don&#8217;t have time to explain it. Right now it is time to go and write some blue tickets in the gold square.
