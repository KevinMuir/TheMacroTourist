Today was the day that the fear finally entered the market. For the first time since this whole budget fiasco started, market participants were legitimately scared that no deal would be reached.

I have been arguing that both sides were quite dug in for some time now and that the market was over estimating the chances at a quick deal. At first I seemed like chicken little. Most people laughed at the idea that the market would do anything except go straight up. I actually saw people saying that no deal was good for the market because it meant that there would be no taper, which meant stocks would head higher.

Well, we are now 75 S&P points off the highs.

At this point, the short side is not quite as easy.

And to top it off, one of our favourite systems actually triggered a buy signal tonight.

I am still fairly short (something my wife likes to remind me of all the time), and although I wish I hadn&#8217;t covered some at higher levels, I think the time to get more close to neutral is upon us.

Now, remember just like before when I was advocating shorting, this stance will seem lonely. Tomorrow we will be bombarded with all sorts of &#8216;end of the world&#8217; prognostications. Although I still think there is a chance that the politicians really screw things up, we are now getting to a point where the easy money has been made.

So tomorrow I will start covering my short position. I still think the high flyers have a lot of room to go down, but the market as whole is no longer a sell.
