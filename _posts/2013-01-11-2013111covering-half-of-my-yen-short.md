I have been extremely bearish on the Yen.  And I have been lucky enough to be extremely short during this latest big move.

However, my spidey sense is tingling and I have decided to cover half of my position today.

Do not take this the wrong way, I am still extremely bearish on the Yen.  But this ship has become awfully crowded and the move has been very dramatic.

What concerns me most is the fact that against the EUR, the JPY has now moved more than 20%.

Although I understand that in the really big moves assets go to massively overbought levels and stay there, I think discretion is the better part of valour and it is time to lighten up.

I will not be afraid to put back on my Yen short at lower levels, but for now I cannot ignore my spidey sense.
