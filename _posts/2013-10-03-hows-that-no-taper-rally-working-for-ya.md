Last time, I promise…

The S&P 500 since the no-taper rally…

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/SPXGIPOct0313.gif" alt="SPXGIPOct0313" title="SPXGIPOct0313.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

Just remember that markets never make tops _into bad news…_ Tops are always formed on _good news (even great news)._

I am not suggesting that this will prove to be a long term top, I honestly have no clue. But I do know that buying on the day on the excitement was _definitely the wrong call._ Now where are all those analysts/traders from CNBC who were claiming that stocks were the &#8220;only game in town and you had to buy&#8221;?

(as an aside, I am trimming a little of my shorts into today&#8217;s weakness… remember, bull and bears make money but pigs… are tasty animals!)
