Remember our good friend Max Keiser&#8217;s December 4th tweet? Something about bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization having a 100% surety that it would eclipse silver&#8217;s:

At the time, [I speculated](http://gfbblogs.azurewebsites.net/blog/2013/12/04/the-max-keiser-precious-metal-bottom/) that maybe Max&#8217;s emotional call might be signalling the bottom in the precious metal complex.

So far, it looks like I might be right&#8230;

Here is the chart of silver with Max&#8217;s tweet highlighted:

The bottom is holding for now.

But wait, Max tweeted about bitcoin&#8217;s market cap surpassing silver&#8217;s. Maybe bitcoin is up even more than silver since his tweet.

Let&#8217;s go check out that chart:

So far the &#8220;Max Keiser&#8221; precious metals bottom is holding. Although Max is 100% sure he is correct, I am not quite as confident about his spread trade. The only trades that I know of that are sure things are from my Nigerian business partners &#8211; for any other &#8220;100% sure thing&#8221; trades, colour me skeptical. I will continue to monitor the situation&#8230;
