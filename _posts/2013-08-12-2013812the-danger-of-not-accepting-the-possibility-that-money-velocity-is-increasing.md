Although I have understood why we haven&#8217;t had the outbreak of hyperinflation that Rick Santelli and KingWorldNews have been predicting since the advent of QE1, I am not one of these traders that says that since CPI appears stable, there are no risks of a breakout in prices.

In fact, I am scared shitless that the very fact that prices have been so stable has allowed the worlds&#8217; Central Bankers to inject an unprecedented amount of monetary fuel to the fire that will one day fan the flames of a massive inflation.  Without this period of stable prices, the Central Bankers would have long ago been cut off from their massive monetary expansion.

My basic tenant has been that one of these days, the velocity of money will stop falling, and at that point, the great huge monetary fuel that has been force fed into the economy will ignite.  This ignition will surprise everyone as it will come when we are least expecting it, and the consequences will be much more dramatic than even Rick Santelli thinks.

However the tricky part is realizing when this change has occurred.  I don&#8217;t believe that there is going to be any formula that will give you the heads up.  We are dealing with human beings and predicting their group behaviour is an inherently difficult task.

Right now I am extremely skeptical that the actual economy is improving, but there are some signs that leads me to worry that my monetary fuel ignition might be upon us.  I am not saying that it is or isn&#8217;t for sure, but **I am worried that I run the very real danger of not accepting the possibility that money velocity is accelerating.**

One of the most obvious clues is the fact that the bond market continues to grind lower.  Most observers blame this backup in yields to the possibility of a Fed tapering of their recent QE program, but I don&#8217;t buy that argument.  In an environment where the natural state of the economy is to de-lever, the reduction of the Fed&#8217;s tapering program will be deflationary and will cause bonds to rise in price (fall in yield).  Since the start of the 2008 crisis, the bond market&#8217;s best performance have been during periods where there has been no QE.

If we are indeed seeing an increase in the velocity of money, that should translate into an expansion of credit, which would result in more issuance of loans (supply of bonds).  Therefore I view the bond market&#8217;s terrible performance as perhaps a clue that the economy has finally maybe entered into a self reinforcing virtuous circle.  Now, I think that if the fire has indeed been lit it will quickly get out of control, but that topic is for another post.  The important thing to note is that a poorly performing bond market is exactly what you would expect to see if the money velocity was starting to increase.

There are some anecdotal examples of speculation accelerating, but it is by no means widespread throughout the entire economy.  However, at the epicentre of the monetary printing &#8211; New York City &#8211; there are some very real signs that fuse has been lit.

Let&#8217;s first look at this chart that I grabbed from ZeroHedge, who borrowed it from Nick Colas at ConvergEx:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/520936bae4b02e34853eb7bb/1376335546250/20130811_cab_0%20Aug%2012%2013.jpg" />

During the last 6 months the price of a NYC Yellow Cab Taxi licence has increased by approximately 50%.  Now, there are some specific factors that helped this rise, but this is not the sort of move you get in a stable monetary environment.  This is actually the very type of speculation you would expect if you threw billions of dollars into the monetary system.

And I noticed this very interesting article in Bloomberg that outlined the problems that New Yorkers are having finding places to live:

> Manhattan Apartments $3 Million or Less Hard to Get: Mortgages

> 2013-08-07 11:23:54.250 GMT

> By Oshrat Carmiel

>     Aug. 7 (Bloomberg) &#8212; With $1 million to spend and no need for a mortgage, Laiyan Wong expected to be able to easily buy a two-bedroom apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. What she didn’t anticipate was how much competition she’d have.

>     Wong viewed more than 10 apartments in two months, gradually increasing her budget to $1.5 million as it became clear that others were looking for similar properties amid a plummeting supply of homes in her price range.

>     “I made four bids and was outbid each time,” said Wong, a trader at an investment bank, who eventually got a mortgage and paid $1.6 million for a condo that was about to go under contract to someone else. “You have to be willing to make a decision in a few minutes and overpay the asking price.”

>     Manhattanites with budgets that would buy mansions in most of America are discovering it’s tough to find even a two-bedroom apartment in New York as the inventory of homes shrinks. The number of available units for less than $3 million &#8212; those generally considered nonluxury &#8212; has plunged by the most on record, creating a shortage that’s unlikely to be alleviated any time soon as developers focus on ultra high-end condos that have set price records by wealthy investors.

>     Listings for nonluxury apartments, encompassing about 90 percent of the Manhattan market, have fallen by more than 36 percent year-over-year in each of the last three quarters, the biggest declines in 12 years of recordkeeping, according to data from New York appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. By contrast, inventory in the top 10 percent of the market by price fell only 3.9 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier.

This is again symptomatic of a highly stimulated monetary environment.

I am not predicting that the fuel has been lit.  I don&#8217;t know if it has or hasn&#8217;t.

Right now my portfolio is leaning that it hasn&#8217;t and I am beginning to worry that I am ignoring the signs that are staring me in the face.

When I see distinguished economists like Harvard professor Ken Rogoff talking about the need to choose a Fed Governor that understands the risks are skewed towards inflation being too low, I worry that we have hit the moment when the opposite will happen:

>  “In more normal times, you’re looking for the central <span style="line-height: 1.6em">banker to be an anchor against high inflation expectations and </span><span style="line-height: 1.6em">to assure investors that inflation will stay low and stable to </span><span style="line-height: 1.6em">keep interest rates down,” Rogoff, co-author with Carmen </span><span style="line-height: 1.6em">Reinhart of the 2009 book “This Time Is Different: Eight </span><span style="line-height: 1.6em">Centuries of Financial Folly,” said in an interview. Now </span><span style="line-height: 1.6em">“we’re in this situation where many of the central banks of the </span><span style="line-height: 1.6em">world need to convince the public of their tolerance for </span><span style="line-height: 1.6em">inflation, not their intolerance.”</span>

This post is more of a warning to myself that it would be dangerous to ignore some of these signs that velocity might have finally bottomed.  But hasn&#8217;t been the case at the other 3 market tops when the Fed tried to stop QE?
