This morning, stock markets are gapping lower on worries about the US government showdown (along with some lingering fears that Italy&#8217;s government will fall). Since the open there has been a valiant attempt to ramp stocks back higher, but I am not going to climb aboard the bullish bandwagon.

I am short for many reasons, but in this post I would like to talk a little bit about the US government shut down.

Over the years, US government shutdowns have been a much more common affair than most would realize. Have a look at this chart I borrowed from Barry Ritholz&#8217;s blog:

<img class="aligncenter" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="shut-downs.png" alt="Shut downs" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/09/shut-downs.png" width="348" height="600" border="0" />

Although it has been a while since we have had one (the last one ended in January 1996), shutdowns used to happen with a much greater regularity.

Therefore from a past history point of view, we shouldn&#8217;t be too surprised with the recent developments.

However, in this case, I believe the past is no guarantee of the future. Most of these shut downs were resolved within days. The occasional one lingered for over 10 days, but none went longer than 21.

This shutdown has a greater than the market expects chance of breaking the record for length. Regardless of what you believe about the Tea Party, there can be no denying that they believe that the government is out of control with their spending. These members of government believe that they have been sent by the people to curtail government spending. Therefore they will view the government shutdown as a victory. They will have no incentive to compromise, and in fact, it will be just the opposite &#8211; they will be rewarded with their obstenance.

Although it might be possible for the rest of the Republicans to make a deal without the Tea Party, the current make up of the government does not favour a compromise.

On the other side of the aisle, President Obama seems to have chosen this as his line in the sand (again) and will not negotiate under the threat of holding the economy hostage.

There is very little room for compromise in either sides&#8217; positions.

The market assumes that at the end of the day, politicians will do the &#8220;right thing&#8221;. This is an overly optimistic assumption.

There is a very good chance that this shutdown will drag in much longer than the market believes and that the upcoming debt ceiling raise will also turn into a political shit storm that rattles the markets.

I am the first one to point out that bad news doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the market will fall. I understand full well about the concept of climbing the wall of worry. However in this case, the market is refusing to even contemplate the possibility that this gets significantly worse before it gets better. The market is seeing through the crisis and assuming it will all get sorted out. The market is giving these politicians way too much credit.
