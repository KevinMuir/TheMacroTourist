I have been bearish on Europe for some time now. There is no way to couch this nicely, it has been a dismal trade. 

My worries about the ECB being the tightest Central Bank have not mattered one iota. It has been straight up since Mario Draghi&#8217;s famous &#8220;whatever it takes&#8221; speech. Obviously the former Goldman Sachs banker&#8217;s reassuring words were all that was needed to fix the troubled monetary union. His magical healing powers were best summed up by Larry Summers who recently introduced Draghi with the following glowing sentences:

> “Churchill famously made an observation about never have so many owed so much to so few. Roughly in the same spirit, I would say that never in the history of banking, have so few words and so little action been as remarkably efficacious in saving a continent, as when Mario Draghi, add-libbed into a speech a little more than a year ago, these words, ‘Within our mandate the ECB is ready to do whatever it takesto preserve the Euro, and belive me, it will be enough’. Those are not the words of a foggy central banker…those are the words of a determined and clear minded public servant, who Europe has been fortunate to have at the helm of its monetary affairs.” 

I don&#8217;t know about you, but I think that comparing Draghi&#8217;s bravado attempt to inspire confidence to the sacrifice of those who fought in World War Two is a little much &#8211; but it is Larry Summers we are talking about here. This is the same goofball that as the Dean of Harvard University said that innate differences between men and women might be one reason fewer women succeed in science and math careers. The praise from such a pompous ass should give Draghi very little delight.

But regardless of what I think of these self congratulatory jerks, the market has indeed taken Draghi&#8217;s reassurances to heart and proceeded to rocket straight up.

European stocks have been one of the best performing asset classes over the last few months:

There has been barely a dip in the 25% run up since the summer. 

This stunning performance has not gone unnoticed by all the hedge funds and other momentum chasing investors. This recent survey by Bank of America shows the relative over/under allocation of various asset classes by institutional investors:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/d3954cf6c2b2493a09491c2d6bd6ed4d.png" alt="D3954cf6c2b2493a09491c2d6bd6ed4d" title="d3954cf6c2b2493a09491c2d6bd6ed4d.png" border="0" width="600" height="397" />

You will notice that Eurozone and UK are massively overweight, while other poorly performing Emerging Markets and Commodities are dramatically under owned. 

I have written before how any crowded hedge fund trade scares be the bejesus out of me &#8211; so this survey actually gives me great comfort in my short European position. 

Although I am worried that I am being stubborn and will be forced out of the short trade at the highs, I am not convinced that this new found enthusiasm for all things European is warranted. 

The economy is improving &#8211; there is no doubt about that. The recent PMI shows how it bounced from contraction levels to above 50 which denotes expansion:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/EuropeanPMIOct1813.gif" alt="EuropeanPMIOct1813" title="EuropeanPMIOct1813.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

However, it is barely above 50 so it is hard to call this robust growth. 

The Citibank Economic Surprises Index, which measures economic releases versus expectations, did indeed bounce hard this summer, but it has recently been stalling out and showing signs of rolling over:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/CESIEUROct1813.gif" alt="CESIEUROct1813" title="CESIEUROct1813.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

The market has adjusted its expectations higher, and these expectations are becoming increasingly difficult to beat.

All the while, the problems with the bad loans in countries like Spain have been merely been pushed out into the future with extend and pretend type solutions. There has been no real improvement in the actual prices of troubled real estate, with countries like Spain still mired near the lows. Here is a chart of the Spanish home price index:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/SpanishHomeOct1813.gif" alt="SpanishHomeOct1813" title="SpanishHomeOct1813.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

Investors might be piling into European stocks, but they certainly not showing the same enthusiasm for troubled real estate.

However the most troubling part of the European equation is the actions of the ECB. They continue to shrink their balance sheet with the tightest monetary policy of the major Central Banks.

Here is a chart of the Year over Year (YoY) change in total assets of the ECB:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/ECBYoYOct1813.jpg" alt="ECBYoYOct1813" title="ECBYoYOct1813.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="452" />

You will notice that although there was indeed a massive expansion of the ECB&#8217;s balance sheet during the crisis, since then Mario has been busy trying to work it back down. This is in contrast to the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan who are both continuing to expand. 

As would be expected given the ECB&#8217;s relative tightness, this has had the effect of sending the Euro higher. It is up versus the US dollar:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/EUROct1813.gif" alt="EUROct1813" title="EUROct1813.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

And also up versus the Yen:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/EURJPYOct1813.gif" alt="EURJPYOct1813" title="EURJPYOct1813.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

Right now the currency strength does not seem to matter, but it will &#8211; the only question is timing.

In this age of massive over indebtedness, there needs to be a constant monetary expansion for the natural credit contraction to be offset. The liquidity created by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan seem to be leaking into the European economy, and for now, that seems to be enough. 

However, as the ECB refuses to engage in this same aggressive behaviour, their currency will naturally rise and ultimately choke off any sort of economic expansion. 

Optimistic European investors are using an old template of assuming that the economic recovery will become self reinforcing. With the ECB refusing to join the party and the massive debt problems merely postponed, it is only a matter of time until Europe is once again in the midst of a contractionary credit spiral. 

Larry Summers thinks that all Draghi needs to is whisper some sweet nothings to the market and all will be well. I suspect that ultimately Summers&#8217; comments about Draghi will look just as stupid as his comments as Harvard Dean about women.

I am short Europe and like an old mule, refusing to give up on my position.
