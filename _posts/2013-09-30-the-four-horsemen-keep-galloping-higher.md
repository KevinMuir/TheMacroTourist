My homemade index that I have labelled the Four Horsemen (Tesla, LinkedIn, Facebook and Netflix) continues to explode higher.

<img class="aligncenter" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="FourSep3013.gif" alt="FourSep3013" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/09/FourSep3013.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" />

Don&#8217;t forget that the index was constructed so that the beginning of the year was 100. Have a gander at the last price: 328.54!

Although there is speculation occurring in many parts of the financial markets, this is the frothiest (and stupidest) example.

I know, I know… I just don&#8217;t get it. I don&#8217;t understand _how great these companies truly are…_

I am sure it has nothing to do with the $85 billion of QE that the Fed is injecting into the markets on monthly basis. For those that think they are the next stock picking super star Peter Lynch I would caution that this will end very badly. It is only a question of when… This is not the chart of rational speculation but rather the results of an insane monetary policy gone awry.
