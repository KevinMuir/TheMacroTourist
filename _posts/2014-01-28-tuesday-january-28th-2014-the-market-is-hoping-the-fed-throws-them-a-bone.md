Tomorrow the Federal Reserve meets in what will most likely be Ben Bernanke&#8217;s last meeting as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. At that meeting, Janet Yellen will take over duties at the head of the table and bring Ben&#8217;s 8 year term as lead money printer to an end.<figure style="width: 355px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="BernankeJan2714.jpeg" alt="BernankeJan2714" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/BernankeJan2714.jpeg" width="355" height="257" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ben hard at work&#8230; We will miss him</figcaption></figure> 

The markets are not one for pomp and circumstance, so they will barely pause to acknowledge the years of service that Bernanke dedicated to his country. Although I do not agree with everything he has done, I think Ben is a good man that acted in ways he felt would best serve his nation. For that, he deserves everyone&#8217;s gratitude. For all his detractors, it is all too easy to sit in your chair in front of your computer while spewing your pearls of wisdom on the internet. As Disraeli said, &#8220;How much easier it is to be critical than to be correct.&#8221; Lord knows I am not correct that often, so I think I shall also refrain from being critical and salute Ben&#8217;s time as Fed Chairman.

During the past few months, the Fed has done everything they can to communicate a strategy that emphasizes

  * that the tapering of $10 billion from QE per meeting will continue absent an economic and/or financial markets severe deterioration,
  * and that tapering is not tightening in that rates will not necessarily rise once QE policies have ceased.

There has been a gradual realization on the part of the Fed that the conditions that previously necessitated the non-traditional QE policies no longer exist. Although they would never admit it in public, privately they also must realize that they are exacerbating the growing inequality problem. The Fed probably would have never guessed that their policy would do so much for the stock market, while doing so little for the real economy. Therefore, they have quietly put themselves on a schedule to wind it down.

However, they have a problem. Last summer they prepared the market for tapering, and much to the Fed&#8217;s surprise, the credit markets extrapolated a very quick end to the QE program and started to price in a rise in the Fed Funds.

Yields on the short end of the bond market started to rise precipitously:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="USG2YRJan2714.gif" alt="USG2YRJan2714" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/USG2YRJan2714.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">US Two Yield Treasury Yields</figcaption></figure> 

The summer prelude to tapering can be seen in the red oval.

It can best be illustrated with the large shift in the Fed Funds Futures curve:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="FedFundsCurveJan2714.gif" alt="FedFundsCurveJan2714" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/FedFundsCurveJan2714.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fed Funds Futures Curve at various points last year</figcaption></figure> 

The green curve shows the gradual pace of tightening priced in on April 2nd before the Fed had started to prepare the market for tapering. However, as the Fed communicated their desire to wind down QE, market participants dramatically moved up the pace of Fed Funds tightening. This can be shown by the move upwards to blue curve which represents the implied fed funds level that the market was pricing in on September 16h, the day before the Fed meeting. This was extremely dramatic and not at all what the Fed was expecting.

To best understand the back up in Fed Funds expectations, have a look at the Fed Funds Future for expiry December 2015:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="FFZ5Jan2714.gif" alt="FFZ5Jan2714" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/FFZ5Jan2714.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fed Funds Futures Contract for Dec 2015 (lower means higher rates)</figcaption></figure> 

You can see that it moved from 99.60 in April of 2013 all the way down 98.60, pricing in an amazing 100 basis points of extra tightening for December 2015.

As the market was having its hissy fit, the Fed then proceeded to make one of the bigger gaffs in recent memory. Even though they had prepared the market for tapering, at the September 18th meeting, they surprised the market by not tapering at all. They could have just tapered less. Or they could have tapered and put it on hold for next meeting. But instead, they just out of the blue surprised the market with a no tapering announcement.

The Fed cited the recent tightening of the financial conditions as a main reason in its press release:

> &#8220;The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labour market as having diminished, on net, since last fall, but the tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months, if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and the labour market.&#8221;

Of course there was more to the story. At the time, the whole budget battle was still very much looming in front of the US Administration. There was a very real possibility that an impasse might have caused a financial accident. The Fed did not want to be tapering into a financial crisis.

The stock and credit markets of course loved it, but on the whole it was not a shinning moment for the Fed.

It can best be summed up with a quote from a former Fed insider:

> &#8220;There’s been a hit to the reputation of the Fed.&#8221; &#8211; former Fed Vice Chair Donald Kohn

With the benefit of hindsight I think if Bernanke & Co. could do it again they would call an audible on that play.

The reason that this abrupt about face turn in policy was such a problem is that it in essence taught the market that the Fed was eager to continue with QE if conditions tightened at all. In essence, the so called Fed put strike price was higher than they had previously surmised.

This is a major problem as all it did was encourage speculators to take even more risk. It is probably the determining reason why the 4th quarter of 2013 the equity markets were so strong even though most models and indicators suggested a much more tepid advance. The Fed had ignited the animal spirits.

Unfortunately it hasn&#8217;t really done much for the real economy, and more disturbingly, the Fed now has a much more difficult job on its hands.

The exit strategy from QE was always going to be difficult. But the Fed&#8217;s panicking in September has made it even harder.

For example, fast forward to today. The market has now priced in an increased chance of the Fed not tapering due to the recent financial market weakness. Basically the market is anticipating the Fed getting cold feet again.

The members of the Fed are not dummies and they are doing their best to try to keep the market on track for a regular tapering at each meeting, but the market won&#8217;t really believe them until it is actually withdrawn.

The market might not believe them, but I do.

Over the years I have found that the market often looks much too far out when thinking about the Fed&#8217;s actions. The market in essence &#8220;sees&#8221; all the problems in Emerging Markets and correctly understands that having the Fed continue to withdraw liquidity will only make the situation worse.

But the market should remember that the Fed is tasked with the following:

> &#8220;The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy&#8217;s long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates.&#8221;

There is nothing in there about being the liquidity provider to the world. Yes, they understand that eventually the world&#8217;s economic condition affect the US, but the Fed does not tune for the global economy &#8211; they tune for their own economy.

And although the economy is not the strongest it has ever been, on the whole the US economy is doing just fine thank you very much. In fact it is quite amazing that the Fed is actually as accommodative as they as are given the stage in the business cycle.

The GDP is running almost 3.5%:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="GDPYoYJan2714.gif" alt="GDPYoYJan2714" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/GDPYoYJan2714.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">US Nominal YoY GDP</figcaption></figure> 

Although employment is a complicated affair with many different moving parts, the trend is clearly getting better:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

On the whole, this is not an economy on the ropes at all.

It is actually irresponsible that the Fed is engaged in QE at all. The Fed realizes this and in the absence of a good excuse to not taper, they will stick to their plan.

There is never going to be a good time to taper. There can always be an excuse to delay just a little bit longer.

I actually think that the market understands that the tapering is going to cause further global liquidity tightening and is _hoping_ that the Fed does not want to nudge the global slow down further down the road. But the Fed is barely going to take that into account.

The Fed made a mistake with QE3, they understand they have created a no-win situation, and they are going to keep on their plan to wind it down.

We have to remember Fed Governor Fisher&#8217;s speech from last month:

> This need not threaten the real economy. The “slow correction” of 1962 comes to mind as an example: A stock market correction took place, and yet the economy continued to fare well.
> 
> Here is the point as to the market’s beer goggles. Were a stock market correction to ensue while I have the vote, I would not flinch from supporting continued reductions in the size of our asset purchases as long as the real economy is growing, cyclical unemployment is declining and demand-driven deflation remains a small tail risk; I would vote for continued reductions in our asset purchases, with an eye toward eliminating them entirely at the earliest practicable date.

I also believe that the next round of Fed monetary easing will be something that does not boost stocks and somehow is more geared towards helping the middle/lower class Americans rather than simply relying on the wealth effect from the 1% lifting everyone&#8217;s boat.

As for the market, I think it has made a big mistake **in failing to understand that the strike price for the so called Bernanke (now Yellen) put has being dramatically lowered.** And not only that, if the put does go into the money, the payoff will no longer be directed solely to the benefit of the financial markets, but instead the average Joe will somehow be compensated.

The market is assuming that the status quo of the 1% using asset bubbles to make themselves richer will continue forever. I think that is a bad bet.

On Wednesday the market will be hoping for the Fed to throw them some sort of bone. I think there will be no bone coming and that the market will be disappointed.

**Things that I am watching&#8230;**

**Icahn taunts the Market Gods**

For regular readers, you will know that although I begrudgingly admit that Carl Icahn is a cagey old bugger, ever since his pissing match on CNBC with another pompous idiot by the name of Bill Ackman, I have lost all respect for him. I have never seen George Soros, Warren Buffett or Stanley Druckenmiller lowering themselves by engaging in a screaming match on national TV with another hedge fund manager.

However there can be no denying that Carl has been on a roll. And like the fact that it seems like Michael Phelps was genetically altered to create the fastest human swimmer possible, Carl seems to be equally perfectly designed to take full advantage of this crazy bull market. He has an amazing lack of hubris and is willing to push positions to the limit. He is also surprisingly media savvy for an old dude and has been able to harness the power of twitter in a way that would make any Vancouver stock promoter jealous.

But last I checked Carl is still human and has to answer to the same Market Gods as we all do.

And one thing I know is that the Market Gods punish those that are over confident.

I therefore shudder whenever I see someone mention the word &#8220;no-brainer&#8221; when discussing a trade:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter" style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="NoBrainerJan2814.jpg" alt="NoBrainerJan2814" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/NoBrainerJan2814.jpg" width="584" height="89" border="0" />
</p>

I also find it funny that he has to tweet about his position size. Really? Last time I looked, Paul Tudor Jones isn&#8217;t bragging on Twitter about the trade sizes he tosses around. I don&#8217;t see Druckenmiller disclosing anymore than he is forced to from the regulators about the trades he does in his personal account.

I am going to steer clear of Carl&#8217;s &#8220;no brainers&#8221;. If there is one thing that I have learned over the years it is that no brainers somehow always find ways to get cheaper&#8230;

**Positions**

**Short S&P 500.    **So far it looks like I didn&#8217;t need to worry about sitting through new highs as late last week the market rolled over pretty hard. Hanging tough and trying to let it cook. Conviction: 4

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

****Long Yen.****  This is a counter trend trade where I am just begging the Market Gods to punish me.  However, I do believe that the Yen is oversold and due for a move higher.  The Americans shot across the bow might very well be the catalyst. **The Yen has started to move my way with the risk off move last week. For now I sit tight.****** **Conviction: 2.  **Stops are last weeks low in Yen terms.

**Short Canadian dollar.**   Conviction level: 3. Also **Short CAD against JPY and EUR.**  Small position size.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various natural gas contracts.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather. Conviction level: 3 No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
