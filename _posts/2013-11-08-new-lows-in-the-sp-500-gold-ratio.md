With this morning&#8217;s better than expected unemployment report, the gold market is getting shellacked for $27 and the S&P has gone straight up in a frenzy of &#8220;just get me in buying&#8221;. 

What is interesting is that this has caused the gold to S&P 500 ratio to hit a new low for this move &#8211; hitting a level we have not seen since December of 2008.

What was once the most loved asset class out there has become universally scorned and sold at every turn. Meanwhile, stocks which were the bane of most investors existence during the 2008 credit crisis have captured the investing public&#8217;s imagination even though they have already rallied 160% off the lows.

Over the past couple of months I have being writing about the unbelievable chase of financial assets at the expense of real assets, and this is just one more example.

I have way too many scars to try to say this trend is going to reverse any time soon. All I can say is that my exacerbation and my lack of even thinking about trying to catch this knife means that maybe we are in the &#8220;just get it off the sheets&#8221; mode that often accompanies a &#8220;disgust&#8221; bottom.

I have no real actionable idea for this post except if you want to take my lack of conviction that this trend will reverse any time soon as a good sign that you should be doing what I am too chicken to put on.
