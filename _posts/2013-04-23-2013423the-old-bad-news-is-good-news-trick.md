This morning there was some absolutely terrible economic numbers released in Europe.  The easiest way to explain how bad they were is to have a look at the Citibank Economic Surprise Index which measures the actual results versus economists expectations.

You will notice that the numbers were considerably worse than the already lowered expectations.

The market very quickly took this news to mean that a ECB rate cut was imminent.  The EUR shed 70 pips and the German Bund broke to new lows in terms of yields:

This makes complete sense as the news was considerably worse than most optimistic Eurocrats were hoping for.  The inevitable weakness that I have been forecasting for the European economy is showing up unambiguously.

However, this forecast of a weaker economy is all that I have gotten right today as I have failed to anticipate the potential of a change in attitude that investors would have to this weakening.

Goldman has issued a &#8216;the news is so bad that the ECB will be forced to cut rates, therefore you should buy stocks&#8217; call.  The market seems to be underweight European equities as this sort of thinking has caused a massive short squeeze.

The DAX is up 1.78%, the EuroStoxx 50 is up 2.18%, the CAC up 2.58% and the Spanish IBEX is up 2.10%.

I certainly understand this line of thinking, and I must admit that I have gotten the direction completely wrong (for now).  Market speculation is a difficult endeavour and forecasting the news is not nearly as important as understanding what is built into the price and how the news will affect the market.  I am re-learning that lesson first hand.

In a typical easing cycle, I would completely agree with the call that &#8216;bad news is good news&#8217; for equity prices.  However, this is far from a typical easing cycle and although I am not going to dispute that my short European stocks call is having trouble today, I am not going to jump on this bullish line of thinking bandwagon.

Europe is going through a de-levering process that is very difficult to arrest.  In a regular economy, lowering the interest rate encourages more borrowing and has a direct effect on the economy.  However, during a de-levering, the private sector has balance sheet concerns that overwhelm any desire to increase their borrowing.  Therefore the actual effect of a rate cut on the economy is extremely limited.  So although I understand the desire to assume that the increased chance for an interest rate cut as equity bullish, the reality is that it is going to have very little effect on the real economy.

In a world where the Federal Reserve is increasing its balance sheet by $85 billion a month and the Bank of Japan is  purchasing double that amount, the ECB cutting rates is going to accomplish very little.  The reality is that the interest rate cut is going to be very ineffective at actually expanding the money supply and absent an aggressive balance sheet expansion policy like the two other major Central Banks, the ECB will be fighting an uphill battle.

The reaction in the European equity market seems to be in direct disagreement to my analysis, so you might be rightfully asking yourself if the markets &#8216;know&#8217; more than me.  I very well could be wrong, but here is why I think that today&#8217;s move is especially violent.

One of the hedge funds&#8217; favourite trades these days involve the Japanese markets.  There are a myriad of different positions that hedge funds have put on to take advantage of the aggressive Japanese monetary policy, but buying Japanese stocks seems to be one of the big ones.  Although some argue that hedge funds do very little hedging, that is not true &#8211; they just seem to hedge with even more volatile positions on the other side.  Given that Japan is aggressively easing and causing the Yen to plumet, this puts pressure on companies and economies that compete with Japan.  Therefore many hedge funds have correctly deduced that the European economy (and especially Germany) would suffer.  Shorting the European stock market is a great way to express that view.   There have been a more than usual amount of European stock short positions in the market.  I am quite open about my desire to not be in any trade that is popular with the hedge fund crowd.  I think today&#8217;s rally in European equities is to some extent an example of the perils of being part of the fast money crowd.

The other reason that European stocks are rocketing higher is also Japanese related.  The aggressive Japanese easing policy is creating a wave of liquidity that is flooding throughout the global financial system.  We are seeing massive moves into any sort of financial assets.  A perfect example is the massive rally in the Spanish and Italian bond markets.  These countries, although their fundamental economic position continues to deteriorate, are experiencing massive bond market rally (lower yields) as hot Japanese money searches for a home regardless of the long term outlook.

This hot money is obviously effecting European stocks as well and simply adds fuel to the short covering fire.

For now, I am going to sit through this short covering rally, but I need to be aware that at a certain point, I will no longer be early, but merely wrong.  If the problems in Europe are as bad as I believe, then this rally will be limited in terms of length of time.  If we are still going up at the end of the week, I will have to re-examine the possibility that I am wrong and be forced to reduce the position.  However for now, I am going to give it room to breathe.
