  Ever since the first round of QE in 2009, the Federal Reserve has been continually overly optimistic in their assumption that the economy will gain enough traction for the recovery to be ‘self reinforcing.’ Each time a particular QE program has ended, the Federal Reserve has expressed hope that the economy would be able to continue its upward momentum, yet each time, the cessation of bond buying has resulted in the economy rolling over and falling flat on its face.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  I have spoken about this ‘stock vs flow’ of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet before, but I wanted to bring it up again as a couple of bloggers that I really respect have recently tackled this very issue and I feel that I have a few things to expand on their ideas.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  I use the word ‘blogger’ quite loosely as both writers are very respected individuals whose market experiences greatly dwarf my own. The first piece was written by former Dallas Fed President, Bob McTeer and is titled <a href="http://economyblog.ncpa.org/which-is-more-important-for-monetary-policy-the-growth-of-the-feds-balance-sheet-or-its-level/">“What is more important for Monetary Policy: The Growth of the Fed’s balance sheet or its level?”</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Bob approaches this question head on and comes to the same conclusion that I have:
</p>

> “ …I see no reason to stop open market purchases entirely. To do so would represent a sharp tightening of monetary policy.

> That, however, is not the way Chairman Bernanke views the role of the Fed’s balance sheet. On many occasions, he has said that it is the level of the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet that determines the stance of policy rather than their rate of growth. Consequently, he believes (as I interpret him) that, if the balance sheet stopped growing at some point, the existing degree of ease at that point would continue. He apparently does not believe, as I always have, that a flow of new money is necessary to sustain real growth as long as the stock of money doesn’t shrink. He believes that the size of the Fed’s balance sheet is what’s important. I don’t understand his reasoning, but I freely acknowledge that he is not only smarter than I am, but that he is much more familiar with recent literature on the subject. His views have been aired among high-level academics at Jackson Hole among other places and survived.”

<p class="p2">
  Given Bob’s excellent explanation of the subject, I see no reason of trying to rehash the &#8216;stock vs flow&#8217; argument &#8211; please go read the full article.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  The economic data for the last 3 QE programs (along with plenty of examples of Japan ceasing QE programs to find the economy roll over) seems to support our conclusion that &#8216;flow&#8217; means much more than &#8216;stock&#8217;. Yet Bernanke refuses to accept this line of reasoning… why is that?
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Before we answer that question, let’s have a look at the second article.  It was written by a fellow of the name Bruce Krasting. I have followed his writings for some time, and when he speaks, you better listen. His knowledge of markets is outstanding.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  His post about this subject, titled <a href="http://brucekrasting.com/bernankes-legacy-problem/">&#8220;Bernanke&#8217;s Legacy Problem&#8221;</a> discusses the recently released Fed minutes which seemed to indicate that the Federal Reserve was having second thoughts about their recent QE programs (from CNBC):
</p>

> Several (officials) thought that it would probably be appropriate to slow or to stop purchases well before the end of 2013, citing concerns about financial stability or the size of the balance sheet,” the minutes said.

<p class="p2">
  Bruce argues that Bernanke might indeed be having second thoughts and doesn’t want to leave his successor with a bloated balance sheet whose unwinding will cause a lot of pain. Although I very much respect Bruce’s opinion, I think he is over reading into the recent minutes, and he himself notes, “reading the Fed’s tealeaves is a bit of a fool’s game. The chances of being right are about 50–50.”
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Instead of trying to interpret minutes from the meeting, I am going to watch what the Fed does, not what they say. And there is no sign that they are about to ease up on the QE anytime soon. The Federal Reserve has committed to the program until inflation expectations rise and/or unemployment decreases to 6.5%.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  The part of Bruce’s article that I found most interesting was towards the end when he discussed the ‘stock vs flow’ issue.
</p>

> There are two schools of thought on the Fed’s QE activity:

> All of the Fed Governors (specifically, Bernanke and Yellen) have stated their belief that it is the size of the Fed’s balance sheet that matters when it comes to measuring monetary stimulus. The vast number of folks who opine on the Fed, also believe this is the case. So the markets, and the Fed believe that “neutral” means that the Fed’s balance sheet remains static.

> A small, but vocal minority, lead by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge, see it differently. This group believes that it is not the size of the Fed’s balance sheet that is the issue. It is the daily, weekly, monthly flows that the Fed creates with QE that is the critical metric when measuring monetary policy.

> The two different views are remarkably divergent in their conclusions. And only one camp will be proven right.

> I happen to agree with Durden. It’s the flow, not the size. We have a capital market that has a $20B “bid” in it every week. With each POMO buy, the primary dealers have cash money in their pockets, and they have to spend it. So they buy “stuff”. The stuff they buy with the loot from QE ranges from Treasuries, to junk, to equities. I believe that the constant demand from the Fed is the gas that makes these transactions happen. I believe that when POMO stops, so does the merry-go-round.

> The Fed will not stop QE abruptly. There will be a 3–6 month wind-down of the POMO buys. We have been here before, with QE1. Well before the Fed stopped buying, markets started to react to what was then perceived to be the end of the QE party.

<p class="p2">
  Although it scares me to be on the same page as Tyler Durden, the fact that we are a small group gives me more confidence.  Let’s face it, over the years the Federal Reserve has missed some pretty big economic elephants that were obvious, yet seemed to be only visible to a small group that were most often labelled skeptics.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  I do believe that the ‘stock vs flow’ argument is obvious, but how can it be that so many academics and market pundits are all wrong?
</p>

<p class="p2">
  I think I have an answer for that…
</p>

<p class="p2">
  When most economist create their models, they use data which is based on the last 100 years. During the vast majority of this time, the velocity of money was <strong>relatively stable</strong>.
</p>

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/50ef06c8e4b0b2671bfc56ca/1357842121725/A14187USA163NNBR_Max_630_378.png" />

<p class="p2">
  It was until the 1990s that it deviated higher than the range from the previous 80 years. The velocity came crashing down with the bursting of the super credit bubble in 2007.
</p>

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/50ef0707e4b090a867445b30/1357842183854/M2V_Max_630_378.png" />

<p class="p2">
  Since then, the velocity continues to decrease. This a classic response to a ‘balance sheet recession’ as described by Richard Koo, the legendary Japanese economist.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  The answer to why Bernanke and all the other economists who believe it is the stock of the money supply that matters as opposed to the flow is that; <strong>in a declining monetary velocity environment any increase in the money supply is quickly dampened with a drop in the velocity that more than offsets any economic benefit from the balance sheet expansion.</strong>
</p>

<p class="p2">
  I believe that Bernanke knows full well that the increase in the ‘stock’ of money is not doing enough, but he is continually hopeful that the velocity will <strong>stop decreasing</strong>. So he increases the total money supply, sits back and hopes that it will be enough. He hopes that the economic deflationary psychology will change and that consumers and businesses will stop paying down debt and instead expand. He hopes that it will become self-reinforcing and that the balance sheet recession will stop. He hopes he will be able to stop engaging in QE.  However, he can&#8217;t because the damage done to the balance sheets is too great.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  This trap is why former PIMCO manager Paul MacCauley said that the Fed had to be ‘responsibly irresponsible’ to escape the vicious cycle.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Therefore it is my conclusion that the &#8216;stock vs flow&#8217; of money is only part of the equation, and that in a declining monetary velocity environment the Federal Reserve does indeed need to continue with QE or the economy will roll over. Bruce Krasting is correct in that a cessation of the ‘flows’ in this environment will have the exact same effect that it has had over the last few times &#8211; an economic slowdown.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  However, one of these days, the velocity will stop going down. At that point, the massive monetary fuel that has been poured on the economy over the last 5 years will finally ignite, and the effect will be explosive. As one of my buddies Matt Skipp who manages the hedge fund SW8 likes to say, “I am never wrong, my timing just sucks sometimes.”
</p>

<p class="p2">
  I wish I could tell you with certainty that the velocity of money has stopped decreasing. I can’t. I don&#8217;t know if this balance sheet recession will continue for another week, month, year or decade.  However, I believe the situation can best be explained like a parent on a road trip who responds to their kid’s question about how long till we get there with the response, “we’re getting closer.”
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Make no mistake. Unless there is a dramatic change in policies and the Central Banks of the world decide to turn their cars around, we will indeed get there.
</p>

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/50ef0694e4b079dad8696f3c/1357842068959/jan6_excess-reserves.jpg" />

A research piece that I read recently highlighted that the excess reserves held at depository institutions has been decreasing. This might indeed be the first signs that banks are once again lending and that the fuse has been lit.

This might post might seem to be devoid of any tradeable opinions.

However, I think it is important to realize that in the current environment, Bruce Krasting and Bob McTeer are indeed correct in that the &#8216;flow&#8217; is much more important than the &#8216;stock&#8217; of money.  This situation will eventually change and the economy will enter into a self-reinforcing cycle where there will be way too much liquidity in the system.  Guessing when this will occur is very difficult.  I am more hopeful that we are closer than most.

One of these days Bernanke will indeed be correct and the massive &#8216;stock&#8217; of money will matter and the economy will no longer need the monthly QE &#8216;flow&#8217;.  Watching for this change is important to understand and catch the next part of the market cycle.
