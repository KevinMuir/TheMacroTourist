This morning the stock market is running like it stole something.  We are into new all time highs for the S&P 500.  The European Stoxx 50 is up over 2%.  It is one of those days that everything seems like it is right in the world.

Yet, given this massive &#8216;risk on&#8217; rally, the bond market is exceptionally well behaved.

Have a look at this chart:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/SPX%20vs%2030Yr%20Yield%20Apr%2002%2013.gif" />

You will notice that the S&P is pushing to new highs, yet the 30 year US Treasury bond yield is barely backing up.  These two series have tracked very closely over the last 6 months, yet they have diverged strongly in the last couple of weeks.

I am not nearly smart enough to tell you whether this means the S&P 500 is over bought, or if the US Tbond is set to fall (yield rises), or if the correlation is going simply disappear.  However, it is something to think about.  We are in a strange period where traders are getting emotional about the stock market rally, but you very well should be careful.
