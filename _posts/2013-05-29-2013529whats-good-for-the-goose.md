I have done some thinking about my previous post, and I have become more convinced that the stock market is getting ahead of itself in its worry about interest rate moves.

Although I am aware that we are massively overbought and due for a correction, I am going to cover my short Eurostoxx &#8216;hedge&#8217;.

It has had a good move lower this morning and it feels over done to me.
