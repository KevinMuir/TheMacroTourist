For the past couple of years, I have had an on and off again relationship with Uranium. I am actually quite torn about the long term fate of this energy source. The benefits of nuclear power are easy to see. When you consider the amount of energy that the world requires, this appears to be the only long term solution. Yes the greens will talk about wind and solar, but stop and look at how much energy a growing China is consuming. There is simply no way that alternative energy can supply what is needed.

Today China uses coal as the majority of its energy source which helps create the ghastly smog that is littering the news these days:<figure style="width: 486px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Nuclear power seems like the obvious answer to the question about the ever increasing energy hungry world.

And in theory, I completely agree. If you could tell me that there would never be another accident, then I would be all in favour of this solution.

However, although the nuclear industry will tell you that Japan was an anomaly and that Chernobyl was not a modern nuclear reactor, I am worried that humans will be humans, and that mistakes will happen.

I am the parent of 3 kids and I constantly grapple with the balancing act of letting them makes mistakes and learning without doing any serious harm. You don&#8217;t want to be too constrictive, yet you also don&#8217;t want them to harm themselves in any way that does any lasting damage. My job as a parent is to decide when the consequences of being wrong outweigh the benefits of allowing them to try something.

As a citizen of the world, I worry that the benefits of nuclear energy might outweigh the consequences of an accident. It is one thing to allow your child to climb on top of the monkey bars, it is quite another to let them clamber up a 100 foot cliff.

The nuclear industry might be correct in their assertion that the new reactors are safer and not something to be concerned about.

Then again, I worry that accidents are never planned and that there is no way to be 100% sure of anything. If something does go wrong, the consequences are so horrific, that I wonder on a risk reward basis whether the bet is worth it. Someone tells you that you can bet your net worth with 20 to 1 odds in your favour, the mathematically right answer is to make the bet. But _what if you lose?_ The risk might not be worth the reward. That is how I feel about nuclear energy &#8211; it seems like the right bet, and most likely the nuclear industry is correct in their assessment that it is increasingly more safe, but what if&#8230;

Since the Japanese accident, my worry has become conventional thinking and we have seen countries like Germany actually shut down some of their nuclear reactors. Others have put their expansion plans on hold.

This created a massive bear market in Uranium and the associated companies.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The constant drip lower in these stocks has been relentless.  For the longest time, it seemed like the Uranium industry was left for dead and that it would never find a bottom.  No one wanted to own these stocks.  No one wanted to talk about these stocks.  They were not something discussed in mixed company.

However over the last month they have been showing signs of life. Have a look at the chart of this URA ETF a little more closely:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="URAUSJan2114.gif" alt="URAUSJan2114" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/URAUSJan2114.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">URA making a bottom and breaking out</figcaption></figure> 

You can see that it is actually making a bottom and has recently broken out to the upside.

The actual Uranium commodity also seems to have stopped going down:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="UraniumSpotJan2114.gif" alt="UraniumSpotJan2114" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/UraniumSpotJan2114.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Uranium &#8211; it has stopped going down</figcaption></figure> 

And perhaps most interestingly, the closed end fund Uranium Participation Corp has been trading at a premium to NAV:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="UPremJan2114.gif" alt="UPremJan2114" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/UPremJan2114.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Uranium Participation Corp Premium to NAV</figcaption></figure> 

The sole purpose of this fund is to invest in the spot Uranium commodity.  In the depths of the gloom after the Japanese accident, this closed end fund traded at a wicked discount to NAV.  However over the last few months it has quietly moved up to a premium to NAV.  It has traded so strongly that a few days ago the company was even able to do a $50 million bought deal financing at a premium to NAV.

Something is up.

Although I have my concerns about whether the long term risks of nuclear power, the massive bear market seems to have run its course.

**Markets love to climb a wall of worry, and there is no bigger wall of worry than the future of the nuclear industry.**

My suspicion is that we are about to enter into a stealth bull market in Uranium. This is not the kind of investment that anyone is going to love getting on CNBC and bragging about. The worries from the Japanese disaster are still too fresh in everyone&#8217;s mind.

But yet, I suspect that the fundamentals are going to win out and that the stocks (and commodity) are simply too cheap.

After the accident Japan shut down almost all of their reactors. But their economy cannot bear the costs of importing other sources of energy. They will eventually have to restart the reactors.

China&#8217;s ever increasing smog problem shows that it has no choice but to continue their move from coal burning electrical plants to nuclear energy.

I don&#8217;t really have a trading recommendation as I am unsure whether I want to climb aboard this trade yet. I suspect that my hesitation is a great reason of why this rise has only just started. [ As an aside, the last time I got bullish on Uranium I bought a penny stock that has recently also shown some signs of life. The stock is Laramide Resources (LAM CN Equity) and it has a great asset in Australia that will eventually be attractive for a major. If you are bullish on Uranium and looking for something with a little more speculative juice, then Laramide is something you should look at. I am keeping mine. I rode it down from $1 to $0.35 and I am not going to sell the first bounce&#8230; ] <figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

**Things that I am watching&#8230;**

**Bank of Canada meeting tomorrow**

The Bank of Canada meets tomorrow. It will be interesting to see how the new Bank of Canada Governor Poloz deals with the unexpected slump in the Canadian economy.

Yesterday Canada&#8217;s biggest bank, the Royal Bank, quietly lowered their mortgage rates. This is the first time rates have been lowered in quite some time.

The market has already done a fair bit of easing and this move was simply following the curve lower:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="BAXCurveJan2114.gif" alt="BAXCurveJan2114" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/BAXCurveJan2114.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bankers Acceptance Futures curve &#8211; today and one month ago</figcaption></figure> 

What is most interesting is how the short end of the Canadian curve has been moving in the exact opposite direction than the US:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="BAXZ5EDZ5Jan2114.gif" alt="BAXZ5EDZ5Jan2114" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/BAXZ5EDZ5Jan2114.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dec 2015 BA futures (white line) vs Dec 2015 EuroDollar Futures (yellow line) with spread between two in green at bottom</figcaption></figure> 

This has had the predictable effect of lowering the Canadian dollar:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="CADJan2114.gif" alt="CADJan2114" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/CADJan2114.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">USDCAD rate (higher rate means Canadian dollar weakness)</figcaption></figure> 

With a sizeable speculative short position in CAD, there are some strategists who are worried that tomorrow&#8217;s event will be a sell the rumour buy the news reaction. I am unsure. I have a decent size CAD short, and for now, I am going to let it ride and see what tomorrow brings.

**Positions**

****UPDATE:  Long Yen.****  This is a counter trend trade where I am just begging the Market Gods to punish me.  However, I do believe that the Yen is oversold and due for a move higher.  The Americans shot across the bow might very well be the catalyst. **** **Conviction: 2.  **Stops are last weeks low in Yen terms.

**UPDATE:  Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**UPDATE:  Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Short S&P 500.    **I still believe the risk reward favours the short side.  **We are so close to new highs that you need to steel yourself for the potential breakout, but I am not going to cover into any squeeze and will sit tight into new highs.  I suspect if we do have a break out, it will be a last gasp.  Be ready for a &#8220;pop and drop&#8221;.  **Conviction: 4

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

**Short Canadian dollar.** CAD continues to quietly sink.  Conviction level: 4. Stops to come.  **Short CAD against JPY and EUR.**  Small position size.

**Long various natural gas contracts.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather. Conviction level: 3 No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
