This morning the bombastic blogger Max Keiser issued the following tweet:

> @maxkeiser: BTC market cap is about 1/2 that of Silver&#8217;s. Likelihood of BTC&#8217;s markets cap surpassing Silver is 100%.

Since this tweet, the silver market has all of a sudden gotten a bid:

Now, I am glad that Max is 100% certain that the market cap of BitCoin is going to pass the market cap of the total outstanding silver. I for one am not 100% sure of anything &#8211; I am even keeping my options open on that whole death thing in case they come up with something in the future.

I do suspect though that the Market Gods though don&#8217;t like this sort of arrogance, and that maybe, just maybe, Max might have made the bottom in the precious metal square.

It just goes to show you how lopsided bearish the sentiment has become on precious metals when financial pundits are issuing these sorts of proclamations. 

If the current bottom in precious metals holds, I am going to proclaim this the Max Keiser bottom.
