I know it seems like all is well with the markets.  Although we have backed up in the last few days, most investors are optimistic and more importantly, making money just like the glory days when all you had to do was close your eyes and buy the highest flying MOMO stocks.  Whether it is AAPL&#8217;s return to glory with Carl Icahn&#8217;s self promoting tweets leading the charge, or Elon Musk&#8217;s &#8220;I am going to change the world&#8221; gravity defying stocks, there seems to be a certain amount of, let&#8217;s call it &#8220;exuberance&#8221; in the air.

As for me, I can&#8217;t shake the nerdy teenager who was always worried about the cops busting in, and I refuse to join in on the festivities.   Yes, the cool kids always seemed like they were having way more fun, but I was never prepared to live with the outsized risks these kids took.

And I believe that the markets are extremely risky right now.

Remember one of Warren Buffett&#8217;s great lines (although I thought he took it from someone else):

> Investors should remember that excitement and expenses are their enemies. And if they insist on trying to time their participation in equities, they should try to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.

There is no doubt in my mind that we have hit the greedy stage.  The only real question is how long it will continue.

I am not going to rehash all of my warnings about the fact that we are 5 years into this stock market bull market and a full 147% up off the lows &#8211; no, you have had to listen to me drone on about that long enough.

The real purpose of this post is to highlight that there are some strange things happening in emerging markets that are worrisome and should be kept on your radar.

I have no real insight into why they are happening &#8211; and often I think anyone who does claim they &#8216;know&#8217; is full of it.  I just know that they are warning signs that shouldn&#8217;t be ignored.

Let&#8217;s start with the one that seems to be at the forefront of the most macro traders&#8217; thoughts- the Indian markets.  The Indian Rupee is in the midst of a virtual free fall:

This dramatic weakness has caused the government to institute capital controls (from Bloomberg):

> The RBI cut the amount local companies can invest overseas without seeking approval to 100 percent of their net worth, from 400 percent, according to a statement on Aug. 14. Residents can remit $75,000 a year versus the previous limit of $200,000. The authority said banks accepting deposits after Aug. 24 from Indians living abroad need no longer keep 4 percent of the funds in cash and invest 23 percent in government-approved securities.

They have also limited the amount of gold you can import.

This market dislocation has caused the Indian 10 Year to spike higher:

Rising rates and a plummeting currency is not the stuff of a well functioning economy or market.  This is a bad combination and indicates that the authorities are losing the confidence of investors.

But it isn&#8217;t just the Indian markets that are in trouble.  Have a look at this chart of the Indonesian stock market:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/Jakarta%20Stocks%20Aug%2020%2013.gif" />

That is an ominous decline.

And it isn&#8217;t just Asia.  Have a look at the Brazilian Real:

It too is collapsing.

One school of thought is that the US Federal Reserve &#8216;tapering worries&#8217; has caused investors to dump emerging markets.  Have a look at these charts that show the increased correlation between the Indian Rupee and the Brazilian Real versus the US 10 year yield (from Sober Look blog):

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/INR%20to%20treasury%20Aug%2020%2013.PNG" /><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/BRL%20to%20treasury%20Aug%2020%2013.PNG" />

There can be no doubt that the correlation has increased dramatically, but I am not sure if that is causal or coincidental.

My gut feeling is that the tapering talk has unfortunately occurred at the same time that China has embarked on a dramatic rebalancing of their economy and that too often investors are mistaking Chinese capital flow changes with tapering fears.  My long held premise was that China&#8217;s economic policies of the 2000s caused inflation and interest rates to be lower than the natural equilibrium.  When these policies finally changed, I have suggested that interest rates would rise and that inflation would also rear its ugly head.  I believe that the bond market rout of the past month has way more to do with China than it does about the tapering worries.  The tapering worry is simply an easy to explain sound bite for financial journalist.  I contend that it is much more complex and that tapering has way less an effect on the market than most investors believe.  Reducing the amount of bonds that the Federal Reserve buys from $85 billion a month to $65 billion is really not that dramatic.  It simply slightly reduces the speed at which the Federal Reserve balance sheet is growing.  Having China completely reorient their economy is a dramatic event whose effects we are only starting to understand.

Which brings me back to the recent terrible market action in emerging markets.  I think you ignore those signals at your own peril.  It is like you can hear the sirens, but the cool kids are telling you that the cops are headed somewhere else.
