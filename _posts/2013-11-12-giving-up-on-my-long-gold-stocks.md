A month ago I bought some GDX (gold stock index ETF) on the gap upward.

It worked for a while and moved upwards nicely from $24 to above $26 (my purchase point is circled in red):

My gains were short lived as over the last couple of weeks it has traded like the grim reaper is at the door. It slipped below my entry last week, but seemed to hold in there, so I held tight. But there is no denying that the price action is just terrible. 

Although I am loathe to give away my hard fought for position, the fact that we are getting absolutely no bounce leads me to conclude that this bear market in gold and the miners is not quite over. 

I am giving up on my long gold stock trade. I don&#8217;t mind chasing it higher later if I am wrong, but for now I will feel better sitting on the sidelines with some ammo in case the capitulation turns even more ugly.

If you have a look at the longer term chart, you will notice that GDX is forming a long rolling base:

I am not anticipating that the lows from this summer will be taken out, but I was more hopeful that the bottoming process had ended and that maybe we could chug higher. I suspect that gold and the gold miners will continue to frustrate both the bulls and bears alike &#8211; going nowhere in the process.
