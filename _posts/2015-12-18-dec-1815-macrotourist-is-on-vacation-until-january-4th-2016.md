The MacroTourist is checking out his trading turret and heading to the cottage to spend Christmas with the family. 

There will be no more MacroTourist updates until January 4th, 2016.

It has been pretty warm on the East coast of North America, so I hope no one minds that I have made some adjustments to my Santa suit&#8230;
