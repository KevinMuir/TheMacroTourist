In my previous post I explained that I was ringing the register on my Talisman Energy long.  The fact that analysts are now recommending the story on hopes that activist investors will make everything better concerns me.  I had a decent little win and it is time to head to the sidelines.

An alternative activist investor story that is flying below the radar is Ithaca Energy.  Although I have long liked this stock (much to my trading account balance&#8217;s chagrin), I had given up on the long position late last year.  The market did not seem to appreciate the same value that I saw and I had become frustrated waiting for this discount to be narrowed.

Obviously I was not alone in my frustration as last week, JEC Capital Partners and another shareholder, issued the following press release:

> **Concerned Shareholders of Ithaca Energy Inc. Requisition Meeting of Shareholders**

> **CALGARY, ALBERTA&#8211;(Marketwire &#8211; Feb. 14, 2013) &#8211;** JEC Capital Partners, LLC and another shareholder (together, the &#8220;**Concerned Shareholders**&#8220;) today requisitioned a meeting of the shareholders of Ithaca Energy Inc. (&#8220;**Ithaca**&#8221; or the &#8220;**Company**&#8220;) pursuant to section 142 of the _Business Corporations Act_ (Alberta), to elect two new independent directors to the board of directors of Ithaca (the &#8220;**Requisition**&#8220;). Together, the Concerned Shareholders own more than 7% of Ithaca&#8217;s outstanding shares. The Concerned Shareholders have made the Requisition with the goal of significantly enhancing Ithaca&#8217;s shareholder value.

> The Concerned Shareholders have requested that the requisitioned meeting occur by no later than April 8, 2013, which provides the current board of Ithaca with ample time to call and hold a meeting. The Concerned Shareholders believe that the requisitioned meeting is required in order to prevent further deterioration of shareholder value.

> The Concerned Shareholders believe that the election of the two new directors at this time is critical to the future success of Ithaca in creating shareholder value. Ithaca&#8217;s current board has stagnated, undergoing only one change since 2008 and the independent directors own virtually no shares in the Company (less than 0.72%), contrary to principles of good corporate governance and at odds with the interests of the Company&#8217;s shareholders. Since early 2010, Ithaca&#8217;s share price has not sustained any increase in value, except on one occasion, during the failed strategic process that the current board oversaw over a year ago. During the past five months, JEC Capital Partners, LLC has made numerous attempts to engage the current board in constructive dialogue regarding strategic actions to maximize shareholder value, without success. While the Concerned Shareholders believe that no single director is solely responsible for the loss in shareholder value, the board as a whole should bear responsibility for the inability to effectively advance the interests of shareholders.

> Michael Torok, Managing Director at JEC Capital Partners, LLC said:

> &#8220;As Ithaca continues to talk about its ability to finance acquisitions with its existing credit facility, JEC Capital has grown increasingly concerned that Ithaca will continue to pursue a strategy that has already failed to generate any shareholder value. This failure is ever apparent by the share price. With the GSA development continuing and major milestones to be achieved this year, we believe Ithaca should immediately rectify the decrease in shareholder value through a formal auction process designed to lead to a sale of the entire Company. Ithaca currently trades at a significant discount to its net asset value despite its attractive assets, with production expected to increase from 7,000 boepd to over 20,000 boepd in the next 12 months.&#8221;

> Detailed information on the nominees of JEC Capital, and the purpose and history leading up to the Requisition will be provided in the information circular of the Concerned Shareholders, which will be filed on SEDAR prior to the requisitioned shareholders&#8217; meeting.

The stock popped 5% on the news, but has since merely continued its meandering path sideways:

The stock is dirt cheap and although every investor believes his stock offers fundamental value, we now also have an activist investor who is going to agitate for change. If you recall, this stock was subject to a takeover offer last year.  The offer failed when the stock market turned downward, but since then, the underlying fundamental business of Ithaca has only improved.

Although JEC Capital Partners are not oil & gas experts by any means, they do have a history of identifying cheap stocks, amassing a position and then getting the stock sold.  Have a look at this recap of their previous foray into the Canadian stock market:

> Miranda Technologies Inc. is the latest Canadian company to succumb to the pressures of U.S. activist investors, delivering a blockbuster $345-million takeover offer Tuesday that wiped away years of disappointment for shareholders.

> Montreal-based Miranda, a global provider of broadcast television technology, has agreed to sell to St. Louis-based Belden Inc. for $17 per share, a 64-per-cent premium to the stock’s closing price on MondayÖ. Miranda’s stock soared in Toronto on Tuesday, closing 13 cents shy of the offer price in heavy trading.

> Belden was not an obvious buyer given that its focus is in cabling and it has no overlapping business with Miranda, said CIBC analyst Todd Coupland. “It surprised a lot of people.”

> But the deal represents a successful turn of events for shareholders after Miranda formally put itself up for sale in March, three months after two U.S. funds, JEC Capital Partners and JMB Capital Partners, with a combined 10 per cent of the stock, began agitating publicly for an overhaul of the board and more aggressive moves to create value for shareholders.

> Although Miranda’s board rebuffed their attempt to force an early vote, it did agree to add one of the activist group’s four proposed alternate directors (broadcast veteran Tim Thorsteinson) to the slate put before shareholders at the annual meeting in April. Shareholders reacted coolly, giving the revised board 72 per cent voting support.

> JEC managing director Peter Heiland said in a statement his firm “was pleased when Miranda’s board agreed with us and engaged interested parties through its structured sale process. The outcome of that process is great for the company, its employees and its shareholders.” He said the offer price was “fair” and encouraged others to vote for it.

> Miranda’s chief financial officer, Mario Settino, denied that the activist funds were “directly” responsible for instigating the sale, but added, “Even though they’re activist shareholders, they’re still shareholders. And we listen to all our shareholders.”

> The power struggle for the future of Miranda came as financial results were steadily improving. Earnings doubled in each of the past two years, to $1.04 per share in 2011, while revenues reached $181.9-million last year, up 27 per cent from 2010. “They’ve been outgrowing the market for the last year and doing very well,” said National Bank Financial analyst Kris Thompson.

> Belden, which has bought three other broadcast technology companies in the last three years, said it would leave Miranda management, including chief executive Strath Goodship, in place at the 22-year-old company. “[Mr. Goodship’s] experience and strong customer relationships are valuable assets,” Belden CEO John Stroup said on a conference call.

> Montreal-based small cap fund manager Sebastian van Berkom said Miranda got a “fantastic” price after it underwent a similar fate of many Canadian high-tech firms, selling to much larger global high-tech giants. “The problem with a lot of these companies is they can’t scale themselves to go to the next level,” he said.

And just in case you wonder if JEC made any money for their investors, have a gander at the chart:

So let&#8217;s recap:

  * IAE, the subject of a previous takeover attempt that was aborted due to market conditions last year is trading at levels significantly below the rumoured takeout price.
  * The stock is trading in a &#8216;sleepy&#8217; manner and can&#8217;t seem to generate any excitement even though the underlying fundamentals of the business are only improving.
  * An activist investor, that has a great track record of creating value for their shareholders, has taken a big position in IAE and is asking for two seats on the board.
  * The stock has barely budged and can be purchased at a similar price that the big investor most likely paid.

Although the TLM turnaround very well might work, in my books IAE is a much better risk reward.   I am continuing to amass a large IAE position.
