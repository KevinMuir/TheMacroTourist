Last night in a stunning development, the Turkish Central Bank cranked up all of their interest rates in a bold &#8220;all in&#8221; gamble to stabilize their financial markets. From Bloomberg:

> Jan. 29 (Bloomberg) &#8212; Turkey’s central bank raised all its main interest rates at an emergency meeting, resisting political pressure and reversing years of policy, after the lira slid to a record low.
> 
> The bank in Ankara raised the benchmark one-week repo rate to 10 percent from 4.5 percent, according to a statement posted on its website at midnight. It also raised the overnight lending rate to 12 percent from 7.75 percent, and the overnight borrowing rate to 8 percent from 3.5 percent. The lira extended gains after the announcement, adding 3 percent to 2.18 per dollar at 1 a.m. in Istanbul.

The Turkish Lira roared higher against the US dollar:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I understood the move in the Lira. There had been a lot of short sellers and at the very least, this tests their resolve. That sort of market response makes sense.

However, I was completely baffled by the move in the S&P 500 futures. In an insane move, the S&P 500 futures were immediately bid up 10 handles on the announcement:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="ESGIPJan2914.gif" alt="ESGIPJan2914" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/ESGIPJan2914.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">S&P 500 futures trading last night</figcaption></figure> 

I had to check with a colleague that there wasn&#8217;t something else I was missing because I couldn&#8217;t believe the reaction that the American financial markets were having to this news.

Not only that, they actually kept the S&Ps bid for half the night. Complete and utter madness.

As I desperately scanned the news trying to make sense of the insanity, I came across comments like this from Doug Kass:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter" style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="DougJan2914.jpg" alt="DougJan2914" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/DougJan2914.jpg" width="306" height="240" border="0" />
</p>

Now I don&#8217;t mean to pick on Doug (and I am not sure how much he thought this through), but this has to be one of the dumbest claims that I have seen for quite some time.

So by his logic, the higher the rate, the more you should have bid up S&Ps?

Has he thought about what doubling your interest rate overnight does to your economy?

I understand that markets can sometimes see through the valley and anticipate the next move up, but this is far from the bottom.

If this is the medicine that Emerging Markets are going to have to swallow to calm the markets, then I feel extremely sorry for the people that are going to have to suffer through their disastrous economies in the coming years.

Buying S&Ps because the Turkish bank doubled over night rates is like being bullish on a seriously ill cancer patient who has just started the most intensive form of chemotherapy. Yes, the chemotherapy and the rise in interest rates was definitely needed, but neither patient is going to be better for quite some time.

I would say the only reason you could argue that this was even the slightest bit bullish is that it might increase the chance that the Fed reduces the amount of taper at today&#8217;s meeting. I still don&#8217;t think so, but I at least can buy that argument.

Things are getting worse. This Turkish Central Bank move is _not bullish,_ and don&#8217;t let anyone convince you otherwise.

**Reducing my natural gas long**

I have been fortunate enough to be long natural gas as this extremely cold winter enveloped North America.

As one of my favourite sayings goes &#8211; &#8220;some people are lucky enough to be born smart, others are smart enough to be born lucky.&#8221; I count myself as lucky that the weather has made my position so profitable and it is time to ring the register on half of it.

Last night I was watching the news and there were pileups on the Atlanta freeways because of the ice. This Super Bowl is suppose to be the coldest one in history. The news about the cold weather is out &#8211; it is going to be tough for it to get much more play. It is time to lighten up on the position.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

**Lightening up some of my CAD short too.**

I am not exactly sure why I am doing this, but my spidey sense was tingling and I have a nagging feeling that I might be over staying my welcome on the short CAD.<figure style="width: 397px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="FatSpidey.jpg" alt="FatSpidey" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/FatSpidey.jpg" width="397" height="500" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Do you think the suit makes me look fat?</figcaption></figure> 

The CAD has continued to weaken over the last couple of weeks:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="CADJan2914.gif" alt="CADJan2914" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/CADJan2914.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">USDCAD (higher rate means CAD weakness)</figcaption></figure> 

Although I am by no means bullish, I think it is time to ring the register on half of the position. I am covering half of my CAD short.

I was also short CAD against long EUR and long YEN.

I am going to cover the entire position of long EURCAD:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="EURCADJan2914.gif" alt="EURCADJan2914" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/EURCADJan2914.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">EURCAD (higher rate means EUR out performer CAD)</figcaption></figure> 

It has moved even more than the USDCAD, and if I was an unwelcome guest that was overstaying his welcome against the USD, I am even more unwelcome against the EUR.

We will see if my spidey sense has any validity, or whether it is just an over active worry wart part of my personality that causes me to book profits prematurely.

**Positions**

**UPDATE: Long various natural gas contracts.** Selling half of my position today. Conviction level: 2

**Short S&P 500.    **So far it looks like I didn&#8217;t need to worry about sitting through new highs as late last week the market rolled over pretty hard. Hanging tough and trying to let it cook. Conviction: 4

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

****Long Yen.****  This is a counter trend trade where I am just begging the Market Gods to punish me.  However, I do believe that the Yen is oversold and due for a move higher.  The Americans shot across the bow might very well be the catalyst. **The Yen has started to move my way with the risk off move last week. For now I sit tight.****** **Conviction: 2.  **Stops are last weeks low in Yen terms.

**Short Canadian dollar.**   Conviction level: 3. Also **Short CAD against JPY and EUR.**  Small position size.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
