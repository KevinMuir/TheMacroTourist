About a week or so ago, after patiently riding a big profitable USDJPY position from 78 to 90, I pulled the rip cord and suggested that the sidelines was a better place to be.  So far I have been about as wrong as you can get.

The red circle represents where I bailed on the position.

### Why have I been wrong?

Apart from suffering from an acute case of &#8216;thinking-too-much-when-I-should-be-sitting&#8217;, my theory that the next part of the move would take actual BoJ intervention has proved to be just plain incorrect.  The BoJ has continually disappointed with the actual follow through, yet market participants have done Prime Minister Abe&#8217;s dirty work for him by pushing the Yen significantly lower.  The situatuion is similar to the line in the sand that Mario Draghi drew last summer that did not require any actual ECB buying of peripheral country bonds.  Merely the threat of intervening was enough to quell the Euro crisis.

This has some very interesting ramifications.  If there is no need to actually follow through, won&#8217;t more and more countries find this an attractive means of trying to prop up their economies?

Which brings me to my next point.  Not Everyone can devalue.  Someone&#8217;s currency has to rise.  Leaders from countries such as France and Brazil are correctly calling out the Japanese policy as a form of currency manipulation.  Although I believe that Japan will eventually follow through on their aggressive currency devaluation with aggressive deeds, as they say in show business &#8211; timing is everything.

There is a big G20 wing-ding scheduled for February 15th.  The Japanese do not want the entire meeting to be the rest of the world screaming at them for their policies.  Therefore I think there is a decent chance that Japan is going to try to slow down the rate of depreciation in the coming days.

Today&#8217;s move was in large part a reaction that head BoJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa would leave his post three weeks earlier than expected, along with two other bank governors.  This has lit a fire under USDJPY as the market is correctly anticipating that the new extreme doves that Prime Minister Abe has planned will be in place that much sooner.

However, we are approaching the point where sentiment is so lopsided, everything will be already built into the price.  Any actual policy change might trigger a &#8216;sell on the news&#8217; reaction.

Although I have been dead wrong on my call to lighten up on the short Yen trade, I am sticking to it and will not be chasing it in here.

I believe we are going to get a correction in time and/or price that will provide a much better re-entry point.
