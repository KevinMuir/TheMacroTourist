It was a holiday yesterday in Canada, so I didn&#8217;t go to work, but I was trading from home Sunday night and I just wanted to comment on it.

On the Asian opening of the precious metals market, although there was really no reason to explain the move, silver was aggressively sold down more than 5%.

Gold went down in sympathy, but the move was much more subdued.

The silver market was halted 4 times at the NYMEX due to the aggressive selling:

    <strong>*SILVER TRADING WAS HALTED FOUR TIMES OVERNIGHT, CME GROUP SAYS</strong>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    <strong>*SILVER TRADING WAS STOPPED FOUR TIMES IN 20-SECOND HALTS</strong>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    <strong>*SILVER TRADING WAS HALTED IN `STOP-LOGIC EVENTS&#8217;, CME SAYS</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

The gold bugs love to attribute these types of dramatic unexplained moves to Central Bank or TBTF bank manipulation.  During the last decade of rising precious metal prices, the gold bugs had no problem describing unexplainable up moves as the result of markets recognizing the &#8216;fundamentals&#8217; of the gold/silver market, yet on the way down, suddenly everything is &#8216;manipulation.&#8217;

Well, I call bullshit on that one.  The markets went up way higher than it ever should have because of aggressively speculation, and now that these bozos are unwinding their trades, the market is going way lower than it should.

I am not going to bother defending the idea that there is or is not Central Bank manipulation, it is a bit like arguing about the existence of God &#8211; not an argument anyone is going to win and everyone is just going to leave thinking the other side is a jerk.

Let&#8217;s just accept the selling for what it is and figure out how to profit from it.

There is no doubt that waking up on Monday morning in Asia and pounding the silver market down 5% is a pretty stupid move.  So either the gold bugs are correct and it is Central Bank manipulation trying to move illiquid markets, or someone is in big trouble.

If it is Central Bank manipulation, then I am not that worried because I subscribe to the Warren Buffett school of short selling.  Buffett welcomes short sellers of his stock because he knows they are only going to have to buy it back later at a higher price.  If Central Banks are pushing their luck and trying to manipulate gold and silver lower, then they will eventually get themselves into a lot of trouble.

If it is a big seller that is in trouble and is this desperate, then I am even more bullish over the short term.  This process of Sunday night puking out of position is shifting the long positions from weak hands to strong ones.

Either way, the real question is what happened to the market after the selling was done.  In this case the market rebounded hard and finished yesterday at the highs of the day.

On a long term basis, this was exactly the sort of action that you want to see from markets that are trying to find a bottom:

The new low was firmly rejected and the buyers have indicated that this attempt to scare the market lower will not work (at least not for now).

Although this definitely a catching falling knives trade, I bought a whack of silver yesterday and will be adding to my position if the lows continue to hold.
