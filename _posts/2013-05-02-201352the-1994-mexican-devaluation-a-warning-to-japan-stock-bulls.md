I am not a big fan of conferences or luncheons where strategists present their views of the world to a bunch of suits chewing on their rubber chicken.  However, there is one conference where I was actually thinking about attending and in hindsight, I regret my laziness getting the better of me.

That conference is the Grant&#8217;s Interest Rate Observer conference that was held last month in New York City.

This morning Chris Mayer from the Daily Reckoning had a [great blog post](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/dailyreckoning/~3/1azx6Kv_F9U/) outlining two very differing arguments regarding the prospect for Japanese stocks.

> Mark Yusko, the CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, was there. He said Japanese stocks are a buy. Emphatically so. The argument was that a weaker yen would bring profits for exporters. And that inflation (or currency devaluation) is good for stocks.

> He particularly liked the financial companies in Japan. “These stocks are going to go up,” he said. “It’s not a question of whether they might go up, it’s not a question of whether they might do well and make profits. They’re going to go up…”

Then Chris went on to recap the argument from the famous Japan bear Kyle Bass:

> Kyle Bass, chief of Hayman Capital Management, was also there and presented right after Yusko. If Yusko was a guy waving a red cape in front of the bulls, Bass was a guy brandishing a sword.

> Bass, if you know anything about him, was one of those who made a fortune by predicting the subprime mortgage crisis. You may also know that he’s been predicting disaster in Japan for a few years now. Nonetheless, on quality of the arguments, I give the nod to Bass. He dispatched the Japan bull with a few thrusts of his sword.

> The first thrust was to bring up Mexico in 1994 during the so-called Tequila Crisis. The Mexican government, much like Japan today, told the world what it was going to do. It was going to print a lot of money and devalue the peso.

> “In theory,” Bass said, “Mexican equities should have taken off with that 60-70% currency devaluation. But what happened? In 40 days, they dropped 70%. You lost 60-70% on the currency, plus 70% on the equity… And look at how fast it happened. It happened very, very quickly. In a month’s time, things literally fell apart. You couldn’t act fast enough.”

> The Japan bull thesis, already dealt a mortal blow, staggered… but Bass wasn’t finished. Next, he took the sword to Japan’s sorry fiscal condition. Japan is insolvent, he said. Everyone knows it. The only question is how long they can hold on. He walked through some back-of-the-envelope math on what this means for Japanese bonds. On reasonable assumptions, he arrived at an 83% haircut. Ouch.

> The bull was bleeding now, breathing heavily. Bass kept at him…

> Yusko, and others, say a weak yen will be great for Japanese exporters. What they miss, Bass said, is that about 16% of the Japanese economy is imports. So imported goods immediately become more expensive as the yen weakens. Exports take longer to adjust. “Your terms of trade actually worsen at first,” Bass said. “I think that’s going to be a shock to people who own equities.” (He also used a great term I’ve not heard before — “macro tourists” — to derisively refer to those who buy stocks for flimsy macro reasons but have no expertise in global markets.)

> The bull was nearly spent. Bass moved in to deliver the final cut…

> “I think the average Japanese person will lose maybe a third or 40% of their purchasing power,” he said, getting more apocalyptic as the minutes ticked away. He talked about the social risks in Japan. “You don’t want to be the only man standing in a place where everyone is losing 70% of their purchasing power,” he said. The crisis in Japan would destabilize the whole region, he said, and lead to social unrest. I had visions of mobs, firebombs, tear gas, spilled miso soup…

Bass&#8217; argument about the Mexican peso devaluation led me to pull up some Bloomberg charts to see if he was correct.  Was his argument that the stock market would provide no real safety in times of severe inflation and devaluation correct?  Although I respect Bass tremendously, I always think a little of Reagan&#8217;s &#8216;trust but verify&#8217; is a worthwhile exercise.

So let&#8217;s first have a look at the Mexican Peso during this period.  I have put the a big red line at the week-end devaluation on every chart at the same point:

Pretty ugly.  Over night the value of the Peso was halved and the pain didn&#8217;t stop there as it went on to continue to plumet during the next couple of years.

So what did that mean for stocks?  First, the Mexican Bolsa in Peso terms:

Strangely enough, the stock market did not go up as many &#8216;stocks will provide safety against devaluation and inflation&#8217; proponents would suggest.  It did eventually bottom and head higher, but there was a fair amount of pain before the bottom was put in.  Also, in the grand scheme of things, considering that the Peso was halved overnight, the stock market dramatically under performed.

Let&#8217;s look at what a US investor of Mexican stocks would have experienced in US dollars:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/MEXBOL%20USD%20May%2002%2013.gif" />

There was basically no bounce in the Mexican stock market for foreign investors.

What about Mexican investors?  Yes, stocks eventually rose, but the return was pretty mediocre considering the haircut they took on their currency.  Stocks did not protect you against the massive devaluation.

Well, if stocks didn&#8217;t work, what did?

Although many in the financial community love to make fun of it, there was really only one thing that saved a Mexican investor.  Yup, you got it &#8211; gold.

Let&#8217;s first look at gold in US dollar terms during this period:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/GOLD%20in%20USD%20May%2002%2013.gif" />

Although it eventually perked it&#8217;s head up a couple of years later, our little yellow friend basically went sideways in US dollar terms during the period immediately following the Mexican peso collapse.

However, in Peso terms, the chart looks dramatically different:

That is an asset that offered some real protection against the devaluation!

I have heard Kyle Bass say that if he could only put on one trade for the next decade it would be to buy gold in Yen terms.

I must admit to being very sympathetic to Bass&#8217; arguments that buying Japanese stocks is probably more fraught with risk than the market realizes.
