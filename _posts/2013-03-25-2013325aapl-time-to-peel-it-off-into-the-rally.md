A few weeks ago I used the few remaining fingers that are still on my hand to catch the [AAPL falling knife.](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2013/3/4/aapl-i-hear-even-tim-cook-is-bearish)

Since then I have been lucky enough to not lose any more fingers and AAPL has rallied smartly.

From a low of around $420 we are now up to $470.

As I am increasingly getting nervous about the stock market, it is time to do a little more spring cleaning and jettison the AAPL long.

(for those AAPL bulls out there, you should take this as great news as it probably means the rally is about to get really strong shortly)
