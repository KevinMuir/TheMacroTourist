I have been a little light on the posts lately.  Our firm has recently made an expansion, and upon graduating this April, Chris has joined our team.  The two of us are working on some shorter term trading strategies and it has made my finding time to write a little tougher.  I promise to get more disciplined about posting in the coming weeks.

My previous post was a comment about a great chart that David Rosenberg published, and at the risk of seeming to be a little too focused on Rosenberg, this morning I would like to also make another comment on a recent Financial Post article that featured the famous Wall Street bear.

The title of the article is &#8220;Beware a &#8216;balls to the walls&#8217; bull market &#8211; David Rosenberg.&#8221;

> Almost without fail, the market pauses on bull-bear spreads north of 30, says David Rosenberg.

> Time to dust off your contrarian hat, says economist David Rosenberg, because there’s a bull market out there, but it’s in optimism.

> The Investor’s Intelligence poll is the latest in a “long string of sentiment measures suggesting ‘balls-to-the-walls’ bullishness,” Gluskin-Sheff’s chief economist says. “Which leaves me a tad chilled from a contrary perspective.”

> The bull camp topped 52.1% in past week up from 47.9%, while the bears stayed low at 19.8%. That 32.2 percentage point spread doesn’t auger well, as “almost without fail, the market pauses on bull-bear spreads north of 30,” he said.

> <span style="line-height: 1.6em">All that good feeling out there means it’s time to remember Bob Farrell’s rule No. 9, Rosenberg said. “When all the experts and forecasts agree, something else is going to happen.”</span>

> And then there’s “Rosie’s rule No. 3: “The consensus rarely gets it right and almost always errs on the side of optimism — except at the bottom.”

I agree completely with Farrell&#8217;s rule No.9 about when all experts and forecasters agreeing.  However, I disagree with Rosie about what all experts and forecasters are &#8216;agreeing&#8217; about.

I contend that this is the most hated equity bull market in history and that there is very little excessive optimism out there.  In fact I believe that you could argue that the equity / bond market flows have shown that many market participants have been actively shunning equity exposure over the last year:

This certainly does not seem to be a situation where &#8216;all experts and forecasters&#8217; are agreeing.

In fact, if you were to apply Rosie&#8217;s rule No. 3 about the consensus rarely getting it right, shouldn&#8217;t we be buying equities and selling bonds?

If you have a look at what is worrying investors, you could also argue that the consensus is actually quite convinced that inflation is not going to be a problem.

Let&#8217;s see&#8230;  Investors are extremely worried about asset bubbles, yet inflation seems to be one of investors&#8217; smallest concerns.  Also interesting that oil price concerns are extremely low.  And finally trade war rounds out the list for least worried about.

In my book, applying Roseberg and Farrell&#8217;s logic, these are the three things you should be worrying about.  This is what I am focusing on.

To me, the only things that experts and forecasters are agreeing on is the fact that there are lots of asset bubbles.  This hardly seems the kind of environment where Rosie should be applying this rule in regards to equity prices rising.  The rule is meant to highlight excessive optimism, not overwhelming pessimism about the recent rise.  If anything, he should have a look at the lack of worry about inflation, the massive agreement that bonds are the safest place to hide and the monstrous flows into bond funds over the last half a dozen years.  This should give him some serious pause about his long bond call and make him re-evaluate how he interprets his own rules.

At the risk of fading the great Rosenberg and looking like a fool, I am short bonds and long crude oil&#8230;
