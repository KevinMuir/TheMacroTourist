I have been very negative on Chinese growth and I have felt that one of the lowest risk ways to play this development was to short AUDCAD.

At times I have also advocated shorting AUD against the US dollar, but I felt that this trade was subject to sentiment swings in the US dollar which at times overwhelmed the AUD fundamental weakness story.

However, while at first this trade was off the radar of most investors (the hedgies seemed obsessed with Canada and neglected Australia for a while), this trade has become increasingly popular.  During the last month, both Kovner and Soros came out with short recommendations.

And like moths to a light, the macro tourists have swarmed on this theme.

Over the week-end, the CFTC released the currency futures positioning and the net position of Australian dollar speculators has declined to a near record low:

Last time we hit these levels the AUD rallied higher for a month.

Given the somewhat extreme speculator positioning, my belief that global growth will uptick in the coming quarters and the technical picture of AUD, I am no longer advocating shorting AUD.

The AUD vs USD looks like there might be a bounce coming as this is the level where it stopped last time.

Also, the AUDCAD looks like a very similar chart:

I am still long term bearish on the AUD.  However, I think it is best to head to the sideline and wait for a better entry.
