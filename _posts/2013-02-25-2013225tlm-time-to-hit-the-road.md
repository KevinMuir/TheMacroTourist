A couple of months ago I recommended buying Talisman Energy &#8211; TLM. Â At the time the stock was down and out, after suffering from a &#8216;Westface is going to make everything better&#8217; hangover.

Well today there is renewed optimism that activist investors are going to fix everything.

> &#8216;Talisman Energy may be next E&P target for activists: Bernstein&#8217;

Now that the analysts have started to climb aboard the bullish bandwagon, it is time for me to hit the road.

Ringing the register and taking my profits.
