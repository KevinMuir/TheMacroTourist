Although the recent Fed&#8217;s taper decision has been met with considerable enthusiasm by the stock market, the bond market has not been quite as enthralled by the announcement.

The turmoil has been hidden within the bond market yield curve, and would not be immediately obvious to non-fixed income specialists who simply punch up the generic US treasury ETF to get a sense of what is happening.

The Fed&#8217;s decision to slightly reduce the amount of QE purchases for next month was accompanied by a commitment to keep rates lower for longer. This move from direct to indirect means of stimulus represented a subtle shift in the way that the Fed is trying to influence the economy.

If the market deemed the Fed&#8217;s commitment as credible, it would have had the effect of flattening the very front of the yield curve.

If you have a look at the chart of the Eurodollar fixed income contract for December 2015, this was indeed the initial reaction:

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="US530GPDec2313.gif" alt="EDH5Dec2313" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/12/EDH5Dec2313.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" />

There was an initial spike higher, but then problems started. The market started selling the front end of the curve aggressively and strangely, buying the long end.

If the Fed&#8217;s commitment was credible, the actually response should have been just the opposite. The Fed was announcing that they were going to allow rates to stay lower for longer, all the while, tolerating slightly higher inflation. This was a stimulative move that should have scared the long end higher all the while anchoring the short end.

So the million dollar question is: why didn&#8217;t it?

I have read many different theories, most of which are somewhat dubious to say the least. Stronger economic GDP numbers accompanied by a poor 5 year auction are typical explanations. But GDP is backward looking and if the 5 year auction was poor, you have to ask why? A poor is auction is a symptom not a cause.

I believe the answer is exceedingly simple and that most explanations are missing what should be painfully obvious.

The market was filled with much too much speculation. There were (are) simply too many market participants long the front and mid part of the curve, while shorting the back end.

I know I have this steepener trade on, and I was concerned about the number of other traders I read recommending the position.

I also wonder how many traders are riding the front end of the curve outright, simply buying sub 5 year paper and funding it in the overnight. If they view the taper announcement as the warning shot across the bow, then any sort of commitment to keep rates low might simply be too little to offset the shift in their positions.

I am worried that the Fed has created a massive speculative carry trade in fixed income and that any sort of withdrawal has sent traders to shoot first and ask questions later.

I have long thought that there would be an increasingly secular uptick in fixed income volatility, but I did not anticipate that it would manifest itself in such monster yield curve shifts from such small Fed moves.

The flattening of the 5-30 year part of the curve has been truly astonishing. The move has been relentless.

It was 240 basis points before the Fed&#8217;s announcement:

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="US530GPDec2313.gif" alt="US530GPDec2313" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/12/US530GPDec2313.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" />

This move has all the hallmarks of a group of speculators that were offside and had to sell.

It culminated in a bizarre overnight move this early Monday morning. I woke up in the middle of the night and checked my quotes. The UltraLong Bond future was showing up 7 points, the 30 year future was showing up 5 points, the 10 year was basically unchanged and the 5 year future was down 5 ticks. I rubbed my eyes and hit refresh, thinking that it must be a bad quote.

But no, some lunatic cranked out his long 5-30 year spread in the middle of the night and sent the yield curve contorting in a illiquid middle of the night spike:

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="530GIPDec2313.gif" alt="530GIPDec2313" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/12/530GIPDec2313.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" />

This is definitely _not the way to unwind your long steepener trade,_ and it demonstrates that this was a **forced liquidation.**

I worry that the Fed has created an environment filled with over leveraged speculators that will cause bizarre shifts in asset prices at the drop of a hat. Today it is the 5-30 year trade, what will it be tomorrow?

I am especially fearful of any trades that are &#8220;popular&#8217; amongst the hedge fund trading community, as they are the root cause of this unwind volatility.

I still contend that the Fed might eventually lose control of the bond market, and that this is the outlier event that you should be hedging against. This week&#8217;s massive move in the yield curve, and the Fed&#8217;s inability to influence it, makes me all the more worried about future bond market volatility in the coming quarters.
