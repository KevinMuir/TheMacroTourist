The market&#8217;s obsession with the Fed&#8217;s tapering schedule is not healthy. In trying to micro manage the timing of the taper, many investors are missing the bigger picture.

Let&#8217;s spend some time examining what everyone is getting all freaked out about. The Fed is currently buying $85 billion of assets per month. The market is concerned because this monetary expansion might be cut back by $10 or $15 billion. So instead of expanding their balance sheet by $85 billion, it _would only be $75 or $70 billion per month._ And this is something to worry about? At the end of QE1, QE2 and Operation Twist the Fed basically cut the market off cold turkey. They actually allowed their balance sheet to contract:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/12/FARBASTDec0313.gif" alt="FARBASTDec0313" title="FARBASTDec0313.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

Even though the contraction was small, any lack of monetary expansion allowed the de-leveraging from the bursting of the credit super cycle to feed upon itself and and this sent prices (and economic activity) lower.

The Fed learned its lesson and this time, the QE3 program will not end after a certain amount of securities have been purchased, but instead will be wound down once the economic recovery becomes self sustaining. 

Therefore the much feared Fed&#8217;s tapering is dramatically different than the previous ends of the other QE programs.

Instead of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet arbitrarily stopping its growth, the taper will simply **slow down the rate at which it has been expanding.** This is a huge difference and although I understand that the market is a discounting mechanism, it is over reacting to the possibility of the taper.

Whether the Fed is expanding $85, $80, $75 or $70 billion per month is almost irrelevant. They are all stupid large amounts. 

Not only that, the important point is that the Fed is committed to achieving its inflation target and therefore the purchase amounts are not going to decrease if deflation rears its head. 

The market is mistakenly remembering the result of the previous QE program ends and discounting the same result for the upcoming tapering. 

The Fed has learned from Japan&#8217;s decade long experiment with stop and start quantitative easing along with its own recent 3 QE programs. At the end of the day, any lack of conviction and follow through by the Central Bank resulted in merely prolonging the de-levering and creating a self reinforcing deflationary feed back loop.

Wrongly or rightly, the Fed is not going to suddenly turn around on their thinking and decide that a decade of 0% inflation and subpar economic growth is what the economy needs to right itself. 

No, the Fed is committed to creating inflation, although they like to call it economic growth. This was evident when we saw the Fed decide to surprise the market by delaying the taper in September. The lesson learned is that if inflation is below their target rate, then the monetary expansion will continue.

You might argue that the Fed is going to change/augment their techniques for achieving their goals as QE does not seem to be as effective as they would have hoped. I would be willing to buy that argument.

However, there is no way the Fed is going to stop trying to juice the economy higher.

The fact that the end of the previous QE programs caused the economy and market to sag so quickly has taught the Fed that they need to be extra vigilant in not letting their guard down in terms of their easy policy.

**The Fed is ultimately going to make the mistake of being too easy for too long, not the other way round.** To bet on the Fed allowing deflation to take root and increase the tremendous debt burden in real terms is to bet against history. It is also to bet against what they have done and said.

As for how this relates to today&#8217;s market, I think we are about to see an uptick in US growth. I know that is a very non-consensus view, but I believe that if you pump enough money into the system, eventually it will cause economic activity to pick up. The cheapness of the money will mean that the capital will most likely be misallocated and brings with it a host of long terms issues, but monetary expansion is not powerless. With every increase in the total debt outstanding, monetary policy becomes less and less effective, but I do not believe we have hit a point where the Fed is unable to influence economic activity or the general price level.

Therefore one of these days, economic activity is going to meaningful uptick. That day could very well be today.

Given the recent rise in the stock market, there is a decent chance that maybe to a certain degree, stocks have already &#8220;sniffed out&#8221; an uptick. 

Which brings me to an important point. Although I am bullish on the economy, that does not mean I am bullish on the stock market. 

My thesis is that economic activity will increase. This does not mean that the price of stocks need to increase. The stock market has already priced in a fair amount of growth, and I would be very unwilling to buy stocks because I thought the economy was about to gain traction.

But if I am right about the economy, then we are going to experience an increase in employment and inflation, which will lead the market to become very concerned about the Fed&#8217;s QE program.

However, to reiterate my earlier point, the Fed&#8217;s mistake is not going to be withdrawing stimulus too soon &#8211; no, their mistake is going to be being too easy for too long. 

My suspicion is that the massive amount of Central Bank expansion is about to catch fire in a surprising whoosh. 

Today everyone is worried about deflation. The thoughts about the 2008 credit collapse linger in the back of their minds. Hedges are being bought to protect against deflation, not inflation.

**I believe that the market never crashes in a way that everyone expects, or has hedged for.** 

I very much doubt that the problems we are creating today are going to look anything like the problems we experienced in 2008. 

Market crashes are created by a lack of fear. The only thing that I think investors are complacent about today is the inability of the Fed to create inflation.

When the economic uptick becomes evident in the employment numbers, the market is going to aggressively price in an end of the QE program. However, the Fed is going to be slow in withdrawing stimulus and behind the curve for quite some time. Therefore I expect the yield curve to get really steep. 

Eventually the curve is going to trade at a disturbingly steep level. This is going to be highly expansionary, and will not result in the deflation everyone is so concerned about, but instead will result in a much higher level of inflation than the market is expecting.

Hedge fund guys love to talk about their asymmetric bets. Right now, I believe the market is serving you up one of the best asymmetric bets I have ever seen. Inflation is running at 1%. The Fed has told you that they will do whatever it takes to hit their target of 2%, and they have backed it up by refusing to taper in September even when everyone was expecting them to do so. The market is convinced that they will never be able to light the inflationary fire, and is fixated with memories of the deflationary 2008 collapse.

All inflation trades are trading at dirt cheap levels. Real assets are being abandoned at the time of maximum of Central Bank expansion. The market is scared about the Fed&#8217;s tapering ushering in the next deflationary collapse.

The only thing I am sure about is that the Fed is not going to taper anywhere near the amount to cause the slowdown the market is concerned about. The Fed&#8217;s mistake is going to be in not tapering quickly enough, not the other way round.

I continue to love my US treasury steepener trades. I am long some real assets with the idea that inflation will be the next big worry, not deflation. I will add aggressively once they start moving my way.
