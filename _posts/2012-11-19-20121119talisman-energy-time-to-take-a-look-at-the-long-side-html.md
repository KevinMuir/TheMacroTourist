  November 19th, 2012 &#8211; TLM 11.25 + 0.19Ever since this summer when West Face Capital and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan announced they had taken large positions in Talisman Energy, I have kept this stock on my radar screen.Although I am not a balance sheet expert, I do understand a little bit about how Teachers, and more importantly, West Face Capital operate. West Face Capital is run by a fellow named Greg Boland. I used to work with Greg during the 90s when I was a young index derivative trader trying to make it, and he was already a wily trader working alongside Roland Keiper and Brian Chapman in their famous bank proprietary trading group. One day, I specifically remember being proud of myself for coming up with a novel trade. It was a little complicated, and when I explained it to a colleague, he didn&#8217;t get it right away. I left it with him to figure out and went to explain it to my previous boss, who was a sharp fellow working on the main equity trading desk. After explaining it to him, he instantly &#8216;got it&#8217;. I then went on to explain it to his boss, who interrupted me half way through and told me to stop. But I insisted because the twist was still coming up. Oh no, he assured me, he did get it, and proceeded to reiterate the next steps to me. He certainly &#8216;got it&#8217; and I realized I was dealing with progressively smarter guys. Thinking that I had finally come up with something worthy of discussing with the proprietary group, I headed over to show my trade to Greg. I walked into the room (their prickly adversarial nature had forced them to be relegated to a separate room) and proceeded to recount my trade to Greg. Well, I think he let me finish without interrupting but I could see he was bored from the moment I started. At the end of my spiel, Greg simply said, &#8216;good idea, but I have had that trade on for three weeks already&#8217;. Not only did Greg understand it faster than anyone else, he had also discovered it quicker, put it on bigger than anyone else would have, and ultimately made way more money than anyone else. Now you see, in my opinion, Greg is probably the smartest guy on Bay St. He is probably the only guy that I have ever met that I would put in the same sentence as the great US hedge fund investors like Julian Robertson or David Einhorn.</p> 
  
  <p>
    So when Greg announced that West Face Capital had bought 11 million shares of Talisman Energy in late August, I immediately took notice.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now I didn&#8217;t simply rush out and buy the stock. Although I thought Greg was buying a deep value name, he probably paid lower prices as it was most likely his buying that drove it higher. Not only that, but the announcement caused a lot of new hot money to jump into the name alongside West Face.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I think the stock was trading 13&#8217;s, but then spiked up to the 14 level on the news.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It was taken even higher by the news on September 10th that the CEO would be stepping down. It very quickly headed $14.50 and the magic of West Face seem to be rubbing off.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, it is never that easy. Since that day, the stock has proceeded to drift all the way back down to $11.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    The fact of the matter is that the market has had a tough couple of months and has dragged almost all stocks lower.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But, TLM has underperformed the average oil stock during this period as well.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is a chart of the stock price of TLM versus the XOI Oil Index over the last six months. You can see that this past summer TLM exploded higher and greatly outperformed. Since the news of the CEO stepping down, it has reversed this entire outperformance and is now back to the levels on a relative basis that West Face and OTTP established their positions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The poor market and the lack of any near term catalyst has made the hot money abandon the trade.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I believe that it is now a good time to re-examine the trade and think about establishing a long position.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am not going to give you an analysis of the fundamentals. Suffice it to say that the breakup value is much higher. If you want further details, dig up a brokerage research report and go through the numbers. But I will give you my synopsis of what is happening and why it deserves a hard look at the long side.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Talisman has under performed for years. Here is a longer term chart versus that same index:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <img class="aligncenter" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="TLM vs XOI LT Nov 19 12.gif" alt="TLM vs XOI LT Nov 19 12" src="/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/50c60ed3e4b026203261c296/1353337263093/TLM%20vs%20XOI%20LT%20Nov%2019%2012.gif/1000w" width="600" height="429" border="0" />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can see that the performance has been quite disappointing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The street has largely given up on the name as it seemed to be as poorly run as the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Ballard era. This caused the stock to languish and head lower until it became a &#8220;value&#8221; name. Then OTTP and West Face, sensing the opportunity, established large positions. Having worked together on previous activist deals, the street assumed that TLM would be shaken up. Maybe they would sell off key assets, or maybe even sell the whole company, much like Greg orchestrated when he spearheaded a deal to sell UTS Energy to Total. However, these things take time, and the street is not known for its patience.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    West Face and OTPP are shrewd smart investors. If they are taking large positions in the name, it is because the stock is deeply undervalued and represents a good bargain.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The fact that this value is not being recognized presently is no reason to lose faith in their ability to ultimately make Talisman a great investment.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So, even though Greg has once again figured this trade out way before me, with a little bit of patience, as of today, I am able to buy at the same price (and maybe even lower) than where he bought. Anytime I can buy a name in a sector that I am bullish on, with his analysis of the specific security, I think the risk reward favours writing out a blue ticket. The chances that the value is not there is very remote, it is only a question of timing.
