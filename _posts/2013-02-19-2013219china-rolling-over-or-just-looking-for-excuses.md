One of the cardinal sins that traders make is to have a position go against them, and then once the P&L is showing some good red scars, the trader goes about trying to find some fundamental reasons to justify his position.

Right now I have changed my posture from being uber bullish on equities two months ago, to a more bearish stance.  So far, the market does not seem to be concerned about any of the worries that are nagging me.

This is par for the course and very much in sync with my &#8216;style&#8217; of trading.  In fact, if history repeats, I will be way too bearish, way too early, fight the market for way too long, finally be proven correct, but basically make no real money because I was early.

So with that in mind, take the following bearish observations with a large grain of salt as the market does not seem to care one whit about any short arguments and my P&L on this position is starting to show some red marks.

I have long argued that China&#8217;s economy and markets play a much bigger role in determining global asset prices than most financial forecasters realize.  My example that best illustrates this point is the 2008 credit crisis swoon.  I distinctly remember the US trying to stabilize the markets with a large stimulus program.  That worked for all about half a day before the selling resumed.  However a few days later when China introduced a stimulus program that dwarfed the US program, the global equity markets bottomed and never looked back.  The Chinese economy is massively important to the global financial system and many clues to future global financial prices lie in its performance.

Therefore my antennae perked up when I read this article in the WSJ:

> The People&#8217;s Bank of China used a liquidity-draining tool in the interbank market that enables the central bank to borrow money from commercial lenders. It withdrew 30 billion yuan ($4.81 billion) by offering 28-day repurchase agreements, alternatively known as repos. The PBOC hadn&#8217;t offered repos since June.

It used to be that the old Wall Street lore was that when the US sneezed the world caught a cold.  I think that adage should be revised to somehow better reflect the importance of China to the world financial markets.

When the Chinese are tightening monetary or fiscal policy you do not want to be betting that China has somehow de-coupled with the rest of the world.  They are the world&#8217;s second biggest economy and basically the only real large economy that is able to grow anymore.  If they are putting on the brakes, I think it is the wrong bet to assume that the rest of the world will be able to overcome that drag.

The Chinese stock market responded quite poorly to the news:

We still do not know if this liquidity drainage is a one time affair after the Chinese New Year, or if it is a sign of a new policy.  Either way it looks like the Chinese Government certainly does not want to see the liquidity take off from here.  It might be a big deal, or it might simply slow down the ascent.  But it is a worrisome development.

I might be just looking for bearish clues to justify my small short position in equities &#8211; I will leave it to you to decide if I am indeed guilty of the traders&#8217; cardinal sin.
