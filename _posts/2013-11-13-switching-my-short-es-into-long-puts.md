I am outright short the US and European stock market. This afternoon, we are pushing up into new highs, and although I don&#8217;t think we are about to explode higher, I am going to shift my short S&P500 exposure into long puts. They are simply so cheap, it is foolish to not take advantage of the asymmetric risk profile.

The VIX is limping along with a 12 handle, towards the bottom end of the range:

I am going to buy back my short S&P500s and replace them with December puts. At the same time, I am going to add a little to the position as I am willing to trade bigger with the limited downside.
