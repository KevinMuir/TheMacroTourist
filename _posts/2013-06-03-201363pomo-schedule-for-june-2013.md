The POMO schedule for June 2013 is out:

A few things to note:

  * decent start to the month with first four days having POMOs each day, with two bigger (+2.5 bln) days
  * second week has least amount of POMO (note it actually starts this Friday with no POMO)&#8230; if I were to be looking to get short, I would have a hard look at this Friday and staying short next week.
  * last week of June is particularly meaty. Â Short that week at your own peril!
