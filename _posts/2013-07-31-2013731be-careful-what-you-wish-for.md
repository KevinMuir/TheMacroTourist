This morning we have been deluged with a series of economic releases that show the US economy is well on the mend.

The ADP employment report came in with 200k jobs added, well above the expected 180k and more importantly, last month was revised upward to 198k from 188k.

Then 15 minutes later, the GDP numbers were released.  The US economy grew at a reported 1.7% annualized rate, much higher than the expected 1.0%.

As would be expected, the bond market has tanked on this news.

We have broken out to new highs across the long end of the US yield curve:

I have two observations to make on today&#8217;s action:

1.  I am always surprised at how choppy the bond market trades and if I were forced to take a position today, I would err on being long as I find that buying or selling breakouts in anticipation of the trend continuing in the bond market is a mugs game.

2.  In terms of the stock market, I would remember the old adage about the highs being made in the midst of the good news.

Please don&#8217;t forget that the market is being supported by overly accommodative Central Banks and the absence of that stimulus will most likely result in the deflationary self reinforcing debt destruction cycle resuming.  Be careful what you wish for, you might just get it &#8211; good and hard.
