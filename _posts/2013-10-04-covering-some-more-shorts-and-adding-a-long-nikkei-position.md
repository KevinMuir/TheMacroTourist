This morning I am covering more of my short S&Ps, and also adding a long Nikkei position.

We are down a long way from the no-taper exuberance spike. It would not be out of the question for the decline to stop and the move to be retraced to a certain degree. I am long term bearish, but I don&#8217;t mind trading for the next week with a little less of a short bias. 

Although I think the market is over estimating the odds of a deal in Washington, the odds still favour a positive resolution. If that were to happen, I want to be able to sell into that strength and if I don&#8217;t&#8217; cover some of my S&P short, I won&#8217;t have any ammo.

I am also encouraged by the action in the Yen and this morning I have added to my Japanese Yen short.

I think the 97 level stands a decent chance at holding and I am going to add at this point.

This chart is the Nikkei, and to a large degree it is extremely correlated to the Japanese Yen, so although it is a complete Texas hedge, I am also buying Nikkei futures (denominated in US dollars on the CME). I will have a big post in the coming days on why I think that Japan has no choice but to expand aggressively and has hit the point of no-return. They are for all intents and purposes &#8211; &#8220;all in&#8221;.
