    I have long held the theory that in this day and age of deleveraging, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s money market operations have a tremendous effect on risk assets. Although many will disagree with me, I think that any expansion in the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet can be <em>immediately</em> felt in the financial markets.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I remember when I first noticed this phenomenon. It was during the aftermath of the Lehman crisis when the Fed instituted its first big Quantitative Easing program. At the time, not a lot of the equity guys really understood the effects of <span class="caps">QE. </span> On certain days, I remember seeing the stock market get really weak in the early part of the trading day. I would climb on board the short side, convinced that the trend was lower. Then between 10 and 11am, there would all of a sudden appear a monster bid in the stock market. Some of the more conspiratorial of the traders would only half joke that it was the infamous <span class="caps">PPT </span>(plunge protection team) at work. Although I do not subscribe to their theories that Ben Bernanke was writing some blue tickets in the <span class="caps">S&P </span>pit, I do firmly believe that the Fed&#8217;s operations in the money markets have an immediate effect on the stock market.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Once I figured out that the Fed&#8217;s operations had an effect on risk assets, I found the Fed&#8217;s schedule and started to watch it carefully.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the past year, although the Fed has continued to engage in Quantitative Easing, they were not expanding the balance sheet at as an aggressive a pace, and I stopped watching their operations as closely.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, with the introduction of <span class="caps">QE3 </span>(which some people call QE infinity due to its indefinite length), I have decided to revisit the Fed&#8217;s effect on risk assets.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We have compiled the performance of the <span class="caps">S&P</span> 500 during the last couple of months and grouped the days where the Fed was either, buying lots of bonds, buying some bonds, not doing anything or selling bonds. But wait, selling bonds? I thought the Fed was expanding its balance sheet, not reducing it. Yes, but the Fed is engaged in <strong><em>Operation Twist</em></strong> where they sell short duration bonds and buy longer dated bonds. It is my opinion that Operation Twist is largely useless as I think the change in stock of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet is more important than the level. This is something that current Fed officials differ with me and thus why we have Operation Twist instead of just straight bond purchases.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    These operations that the Fed engages in are called <span class="caps">POMO </span>&#8211; Permanent Open Market Operations. The Fed publishes a schedule and there is a tremendous degree of transparency about their transactions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We have studied the period from September to early December. During this period, the average daily average return from close to close in the <span class="caps">SPY ETF </span>was +0.0136%. We also measured the Open to Close return. The average of this measure was -0.0543%.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the Efficient Market Disciples are correct, then when we compare the various different days grouped by Fed operations, there should be no marked change from the averages (apart from random noise). Those who know me realize that I don&#8217;t believe in the efficient market hypothesis anymore than I believe that Michael Jackson was just a regular guy who really liked hanging out with children.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Let&#8217;s first look at the days where the Fed engaged in <span class="caps">POMO </span>sales. In this case, the Fed is draining money from the system. On these days, the <span class="caps">SPY </span>daily return was -0.3233%. This was dramatically lower than the average +0.0136%. The open to close return was even more dramatic, with a -0.3851% versus an average -0.0543%. This suggests to me that on the days where the Fed was making sales, the stock market opened higher but was heavy due to the reduction in the money stock, thus taking the steam out of the stock market.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How about days where the Fed bought bonds and expanded the money stock? I divided these days up into various groups. For example, when the Fed bought between $1.5 and $2.5 billion bonds, the <span class="caps">SPY </span>had a close to close return of +0.0026% and a close to close return of -0.0506%. This was basically the same as the average and showed that when the Fed purchased small amounts, the effect was so small not to affect the market.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, when the Fed bought between $4 and $6 billion, the average close to close return jumped to +0.0879% and the average open to close was -0.06848%. This suggests to me that the market would actually gap higher on these days, and then give a little into the close. However the important thing to note was that the close to close gain was higher than the average, which meant that the Fed was still having a direct effect on the market. It just was anticipated at the open.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And although there were not a lot of samples, on the days when the Fed bought more than $6 billion, the average close to close return was +0.3566% with an open to close return of +0.6046%.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am the first to say that the sample size of this project is small, and that this is far from a scientific study. But I firmly believe that the Fed&#8217;s <span class="caps">POMO </span>activities <strong><em>directly effect the stock market immediately.</em></strong>
