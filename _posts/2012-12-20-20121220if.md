I don’t want to beat this issue to death, but I continue to be amazed at how many market participants are missing the fact that the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has basically been stagnant throughout all of 2011 and 2012.

<p class="p2">
  On July 13, 2011 the total assets on the Fed’s balance sheet was $2.882 trillion. That figure actually <strong>decreased</strong> during the rest of 2011, with the total being $2.823 trillion at the beginning of December 2011. The Fed then gave a little boost going into year end, bumping the assets back up to $2.928 trillion by the end of February 2012. <strong>However, during the rest of 2012 (until the recent QE 3 announcement), the Fed balance sheet had been shrinking!</strong> This September the total assets hit $2.806 trillion, which was below the July 2011 figure.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  So when you hear critics moaning about the excessive Fed money printing, ask them to show you where! The Fed’s balance sheet naturally contracts as securities that it has previously purchased mature. The Fed needs to continue to “print” aka buy a certain amount of securities just to maintain its total assets.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  The Fed believes that simply maintaining its balance sheet size is expansionary &#8211; something that I disagree with. Given that the global super credit cycle has turned, the Fed needs to continue to expand its balance sheet as credit continues to contract on the private sector side.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  I don’t want to bother argue about whether this is going to end badly (it will), but rather just focus on what the Fed is trying to accomplish and what that means for the markets.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  The Fed continues to hope that the recovery will somehow become self sustaining. They are hoping that they will no longer need to expand their balance sheet and that the velocity of money will stop contracting. Unfortunately this is not the case. Each time the Fed allows their balance sheet to contract even a little, the economy slumps.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  The pundits that are complaining that the economy has become like a meth addict, with Quantitative Easing being the required drug, are indeed correct. If the Fed allows does not continue to expand its balance sheet, then private sector contraction will overwhelm the economy and cause a deflationary spiral.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  However, the Fed has told you in no uncertain terms that they are not going to allow that.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Now, I am sympathetic to the long term view that as the Fed “prints”, the liquidity will increasingly go into assets that are needed (energy, food, etc..) causing more harm than good. But I think that phenomenon takes longer to play out than market participants currently forecast.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  The initial effect of the two new QE programs is going to be stock market positive. Again, I believe it very well might be more bond market negative than stock market positive, but make no mistake about it &#8211; the Fed is going to create inflation.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Everyone is missing <em>how different these two new QE programs actually are.</em>
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Even Ray Dalio (the founder of Bridgewater and probably one of the smartest guys out there) in a recent panel said, “the marginal effect of QE is being reduced.” Yes, he is correct that “Operation Twist” did very little affect the market. And I guess that Dalio is correct in that each QE the Fed announced, the market has reacted less. However, each QE has resulted in less balance sheet expansion! Of course the marginal effect of QE is decreasing.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Market participants are not looking at the facts, and instead of basing their analysis on the hyperbole of those pundits who are shouting at the top of their lungs about the excessive money printing. (again, I understand that eventually this will end badly, but I am not here to discuss the correct action that should be taken, but merely to comment about the path that has been taken).
</p>

<p class="p2">
  We all know that monetary policy operates with a lag. In this chart below, I have lagged the S&P 500 by a little more than half a year and plotted it against the Fed’s total balance sheet.

<p class="p2">
  Now, think about the two new QE programs that will expand the Fed’s balance by more than 33% over the next year.
</p>

  The only individual that seems to be in my camp is David Tepper, the manager of Appaloosa Management. He was recently on CNBC and basically argued a very similar line of reasoning. Given Tepper’s track record, I am happy to have him for company. Let’s hope our willingness to stand alone from the crowd is going to be looked at as a strength of character as opposed to simply not understanding how markets work…

  I can’t remember where I read this, but I am going to leave you with some wisdom that comes from the Chicago pits. Everyone is familiar with the famous Rudyard Kipling poem “If”
</p>

> If you can keep your head when all about you  
> Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;   
> If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,   
> But make allowance for their doubting too:   
> If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,   
> Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,   
> Or being hated don’t give way to hating,   
> And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;

<p class="p2">
  But not everyone knows the “Chicago” version:
</p>

> “If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs… then you haven’t heard the news…”
