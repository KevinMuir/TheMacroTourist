I know this evening the markets feel like nothing can stop them. The Fed tapered and like a car smashing through a police barricade in a cheesy action movie, the market didn&#8217;t slow one bit.

However, I would like to remind you of a couple of other times in recent history that have felt eerily similar.

First up &#8211; the previous non-taper announcement by the Fed in September. Remember the food fight to buy stocks on that news? It was again straight up with barely a dip for the shorts to cover.

However, that day proved to pretty well mark the high for that month:

The S&P broke to new highs, traded there for a day and then proceeded to head straight down for the next two weeks.

Next up, the recent European surprise decision to cut interest rates. Again, same story &#8211; a move straight up to new highs. 

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/12/SX5EDec1813.gif" alt="SX5EDec1813" title="SX5EDec1813.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

Although the Europeans couldn&#8217;t keep the market up there for the whole day, it was again a push to new highs on a surprise Central Bank move that had _no follow though in the net couple of weeks._

Tonight the atmosphere is quite exuberant, but the party is getting late and although I understand the seasonals are working in favour of the rally continuing into year end, it is probably wise to err on the side of caution after today&#8217;s big rally.

Although at the margin some of the faster money accounts were leaning short into the announcement, the longer term traditional accounts are definitely fully invested and expecting the rally to continue. The market is over extended, showing new signs of technical weakness, with the vast majority of investors looking for a Santa Claus over the next couple of weeks.

Anytime everyone is looking for something to happen, I have to question how smart a trade it is&#8230; Especially after such a big move following a Central Bank decision. So far, these announcements have marked the end of the rallies, not the beginning.

I am short as of late this afternoon, and will suffer through any rally during the next couple of days. I will re-evaluate on Friday afternoon. If the position is not onside by then, I will most likely give up. 

I am not sure whether today&#8217;s chart will look like the other two examples, but I am betting that three times the charm!
