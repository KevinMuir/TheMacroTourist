This morning&#8217;s release of the US employment numbers is a bit of a mixed bag.

The actual change in Non-Farm Payrolls was below expectations, coming in at 157k new jobs versus an expected 165k.  However, the December number was revised from a previously reported 155k to 196k.  This has given the bulls hope that maybe things are better than previously thought.  Interestingly, the Unemployment Rate, which the Fed seems to have tied monetary policy to, rose to 7.9% versus an expected 7.8%.  The Fed has pledged to continue expanding its balance sheet through QE until the unemployment rate hits 6.5%.  Today&#8217;s move to 7.9% is obviously a step in the wrong direction and highlights that the Fed is a long way from ending their QE programs.

The US dollar seems to be the asset class that has &#8216;figured&#8217; this out the best.  Here is the chart of the US dollar index:

You can see that today&#8217;s news has pushed the index down into the support area of around 79.  Will this level hold as it did over the last year?  I am not sure.

Right now the Fed is aggressively expanding its balance sheet and that is increasing the supply of dollars, pushing the index lower.  With the employment showing no signs of getting significantly better any time soon, this expansion seems destined to continue for the indefinite future.

The real question is how long the rest of the world will accept the fact that their currencies are _appreciating_ against the US dollar.  In this environment of meagre global growth there is going to be an increasing intolerance of currency appreciation.

Have a look at the chart of the Euro Yen cross:

Today&#8217;s US dollar weakness, combined with the aggressive Yen devaluation attempts is sending this cross rate to the moon in what our technically inclined friends might call the &#8216;rocket ship&#8217; formation.  This rate of appreciation is simply unsustainable.  The pressure that is being applied to an already weak European economy is only getting magnified exponentially by these developments in the forex market.

I don&#8217;t have a lot of actionable conclusions to draw from these moves, but I am getting increasingly worried that market participants don&#8217;t understand the tremendous pressure that economies whose Central Banks are not engaged in Quantitative Easing are going to experience.  There is simply not enough lifeboats on this sinking ship and we are going to see desperate people doing some desperate things.  The old rules no longer apply.

Today&#8217;s unemployment report simply reinforces the notion that the US is going to be taking a large portion of the lifeboats for itself and the other nations better start to figure out what&#8217;s left.
