As you are no doubt aware, Steve Cohen&#8217;s (in)famous SAC Capital is shutting down due to the inability to come to an agreement with the government over an insider trading case.

I have seen many &#8216;traders&#8217; speculating that it is time to front run the liquidation of the SAC portfolio.

I don&#8217;t know much in this world, but I do know this; sharks like Steve Cohen do not allow themselves to be front run by a bunch of smaller hedge funds and individuals that fancy themselves players.

I don&#8217;t know how Cohen will avoid this problem, but I do have absolute confidence that there is no way that making money is as simple as downloading his portfolio and selling it out in front of him.  Maybe he has already sold it.  Maybe he is even short his own names in anticipation of this.  Maybe he is going to buy more with some money he has hidden away.

But there is no way you are going to make money with information Steve Cohen has publicly given away.  This guy is a shark.  Sharks aren&#8217;t actually mean and ruthless enough to describe Cohen.  More like a genetically augmented shark that was mutated to be the ultimate killing machine.  Now that he is wounded, my best advice is to stay out of the water.
