This week-end Larry Summers withdrew himself from the running for Federal Reserve Chairman.  I had [speculated](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2013/8/22/to-taper-or-not-to-taper-the-market-is-overlooking-the-real-worry) that the decision about the new Fed Chairman was actually more important than some minor tweaks about the tapering.

This morning the markets are all moving violently higher.  My analysis from a couple of weeks ago looks increasingly correct &#8211; the markets were indeed very concerned that a Summers&#8217; Chairmanship would have been bearish.

However, this morning&#8217;s excitement is naively exuberant.  When I read through my twitter feed I notice that most traders are more excited than a 15 year old who has just copped his first feel on a Friday night.

I will be laying out my bearish case in the coming days, but needless to say that this morning&#8217;s excitement is making me more bearish, not less.  Don&#8217;t ever forget the wise words from Warren Buffett:

> &#8220;The less prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater prudence with which we must conduct our own affairs.&#8221;

Also, remember that market tops are not made when the news is bad &#8211; they are made when things couldn&#8217;t look better.

I am not foolish enough to try to pin point the top, and I am an ardent subscriber to the theory that if you are going to forecast &#8211; then forecast often, but I am going to warn you that the potential for a pop and drop is higher than usual.

The pop and drop is when a market gaps up into new highs and then in the ultimate case of it all been fully baked in, the top is made when it rolls over.

The markets are never easy and I doubt that this will be a case of an immediate pop and drop since that would be easiest to trade.  However, I could easily foresee a situation where we look back at the end of the week and realize that the top was formed in the excitement of this morning&#8217;s push higher.
