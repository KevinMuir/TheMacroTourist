Gold is continuing to get absolutely pulverized.  So far I have been really wrong for sticking my toe in the water, but I am not giving up yet.

There are a couple of encouraging signs that I am noticing.

Firstly, there is lots of chatter about gold&#8217;s recent &#8216;death cross&#8217;.  I believe this technical pattern is when the 50 day moving average crosses below the 200 day moving average.  I love it when these sorts of technical patterns with ominous sounding names start being brandied about.  My favourite is the Hindenburg Omen, which when it last triggered in the US stock market a few years ago, was as big a bust as the original Hindenburg.  So when I listen to market participants talking about the &#8216;death cross&#8217; in gold, I get out my blue tickets.

Secondly, when even sites like Zero Hedge (who is as big a gold bull as you can find) start highlighting the persistence weakness in gold (as per the article below), you know that this trend is about to change:

I am sensing that the negativity surrounding gold is reaching quite a fevered pitch.

My best guess is that a few of the big hedge funds that were extremely over weight gold continue to leak it out into the market day after day.  I have spoken in the past about the tendency of gold and Apple to move together based on the fact that these two securities were often the biggest holdings for a great deal of hedge funds.  This tendency is continuing and Apple is also struggling of late:

Just like the fact that Apple has probably gotten too cheap versus its fundamentals in the midst of this hedge fund liquidation, gold is probably also good value down here.
