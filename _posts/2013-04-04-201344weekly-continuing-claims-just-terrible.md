In a previous [post](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2013/4/2/an-economic-hiccup-or-something-more-sinister) I highlighted that it appeared as though the US economy was experiencing a slight economic &#8216;hiccup&#8217;.  Well, I think the US economy just threw up a little in its mouth with the latest release of the weekly employment continuing claims number.  Economists were expecting 353k claims, but instead it came in at a whopping 385k.  This was a big miss.

Although today it doesn&#8217;t seem to matter as BoJ Governor Kuroda has promised that he is going to print until we all feel no pain, I am concerned that eventually the market might wake up to the fact that the US economy seems to be rolling over again (just on cue when compared to the last few years!)

And for those who think that weekly employment claims don&#8217;t matter, have a gander at this chart of the S&P 500 plotted against the inverted claims number:

Bit by bit the data continues to line up that the risks are rising for the bulls.  Right now the market does not seem to care, but bad news can only be ignored for so long&#8230;
