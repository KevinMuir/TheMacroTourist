I don&#8217;t hold a lot of high conviction trades right now.  I am not sure if this is a function of being away for a month or if there are simply not as many good opportunities right now.

<span style="line-height: 1.6em">Recently some of my favourite trades have worked well, like shorting US long bonds or buying gold with a 12 big handle.  However, I am worried that both of these trades might be due for a pause and I find myself slowly winding down those positions.</span>

However, the one trade that I don&#8217;t want to wind down and I am even contemplating increasing is the short European trade.  I have it on through being short EuroStoxx 50 futures against long TSX60 futures and short French OATs versus long German Bunds.  Yesterday I peeled off some of my long TSX60 futures and I am erring on just being outright short Eurostoxx futures up here.

I have read some bearish European strategists that are recommending shorting the Euro currency as a way to play their economic weakness.  I don&#8217;t think that is a good idea.  Let&#8217;s go over why I think that is a bad way to play the European slowdown and in doing so, you will hopefully understand my European strategy.

I believe that most of the developed world has too much debt, and absence aggressive intervention, the natural state of the economy is for the debt to be paid down.  In essence, the credit super cycle has rolled over and the era of debt expanding naturally has come to a conclusion.  This is proving quite a head ache for Central Bankers and politicians who have based many of their economic policies on a level of activity that is not achievable without constant debt expansion.  That is why we are seeing unprecedented Central Bank monetary expansion &#8211; without it the economy rolls over and becomes a self reinforcing deflationary credit destruction cycle.

Have a look at the Total Assets of a few of the large Western Central Banks:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/FARBAST%20Jul%2025%2013.gif" /><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/BoC%20TA%20Jul%2025%2013.gif" /><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/SNB%20TA%20Jul%2025%2013.gif" /><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/BOE%20TA%20Jul%2025%2013.gif" /><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/Charlie%20Sheen%20Jul%2025%2013.jpeg" />

You will notice that these Central Banks have engaged in a orgy of balance sheet expansion that would make Charlie Sheen blush.  It is quite amazing to realize the fact that we are 5 years after the 2008 credit crisis and yet the Central Bankers are still expanding their balance sheets at this aggressive pace.

The astute reader will notice that I did not post charts of the two of the biggest Central Bank balance sheets.  I purposely avoided posting the Bank of Japan&#8217;s and the ECB&#8217;s balance sheet as their charts hold the key to understanding my negative stance towards Europe.

Let&#8217;s first examine Japan.  Let&#8217;s think back to before the election of Prime Minister Abe and recall how their economy and markets were performing.

We can all remember the Tsunami / Nuclear disaster.  But what most investors have probably forgotten is how the Japanese Yen actually strengthened in the months following that disaster.  It was a puzzle that confounded many.

However if you think back to my theory that the natural state of the economy is for credit to be destroyed it becomes much easier to explain.  Japan is further along in the entire credit super cycle than the rest of the developed world.  They have been grappling with deflation for more than a decade.

When the world entered into the credit crisis of 2008 the Bank of Japan did not follow through with the same aggressive Central Bank expansion as most other Central Bankers.  Whether it was because they had already been dealing with with deflation for so long that it didn&#8217;t scare them quite as badly, or whether it was some other cultural reluctance to deal with the problem as aggressively, it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8211; they fell dramatically behind in monetary expansion.

Have a look at this chart which shows the total assets of the Federal Reserve between 2006 and 2012 (before the new Japanese Prime Minister was elected):

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/US%20vs%20BoJ%20Jul%2025%2013.gif" />

The Bank of Japan was about as aggressive as a grade 8 boy at his first middle school dance.

This resulted in an especially massive deflationary force being applied to the Japanese economy.   This caused the stock market to deflate, bond yields to plummet and interestingly enough &#8211; the Yen to rise.  Here are the charts of these three assets over the same period as the chart above:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/NKY%20Jul%2025%2013.gif" /><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/Japanese%2010%20Yr%20Yield%20Jul%2025%2013.gif" /><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/JPY%20Jul%2025%2013.gif" />

Many investors were most confused by the Yen strength.  However, it is easily explained by the fact that relative to other economies, the Bank of Japan had high real rates.  They were experiencing massive deflation and the Japanese money supply was shrinking.  Especially relative to other developed economies, the Japanese was experiencing a dramatic reduction in the amount of Yen circulating.  It is more complicated than this, but if you reduce the supply of something, usually the price goes up.

Now in the long run this is unsustainable, but this is what happened in the period between 2006 and 2012 before the Japanese people finally elected a new Prime Minister that was committed to aggressive expansion.  Since the election of the new Prime Minister, the Bank of Japan has dramatically expanded their balance sheet and Japanese asset markets have responded in a predictable fashion.  The Nikkei has increased and the Yen has gone down &#8211; both expected as the supply of Yen is now increasing:

Now let&#8217;s try to relate this where the European economy is today.

The European economy is no different from any other Western economy and is suffering from massive over indebtedness.  Left to its own devices the natural state of their economy is for debt to be destroyed (paid down) and for deflation to rule the day.

Their situation is made all the more complicated because of their political structure where they share a common monetary policy without a common fiscal policy.

Although the ECB was expanding their balance sheet at the height of their European debt crisis of 2011/12, they have since let it contract sharply.  Have a look at the chart of the total ECB assets:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/ECB%20Total%20Assets%20Jul%2025%2013.gif" />

When you compare the growth (contraction) of the ECB balance sheet versus the exponential growth of most other large Central Bank balance sheets, you realize that the ECB is by far the tightest Central Bank out there.

If the European economy was a young economy with low indebtedness you might argue that they would be able to weather this lack of expansion.  However, they are just the opposite and the ECB relative tightness virtually guarantees a stagnant economy that will suffer from deflation.

The European economy is pretty well in the exact same situation as Japan was before the election of the new Prime Minister.

Therefore I expect European equities to dramatically under perform world equity markets and for the yield on long term good credit European fixed income to drift lower.  And in the most surprising prediction, I believe that the Euro will strengthen.

I think we have seen this movie before and it will end the same way.  Eventually the European people will rise up and demand to join the global race to debase (just like the Japanese people eventually did), but until then to expect asset markets to behave any differently than Japan did is betting against history.
