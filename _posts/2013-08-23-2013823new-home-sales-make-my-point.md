This morning the US released the latest new home sales figures.  The market was expecting 487k new sales, instead it came in at 394k.  This was a monster miss but as soon as I turn on my TV, I am already hearing the litany of excuses of why you should ignore this number.  My favourite was from an analyst being interviewed on Bloomberg:

> &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why the numbers missed so bad, but I think it is safe to dismiss this as an aberration as the builder sentiment index is still at the highs&#8221;

This is so sad it is comical.  The actual numbers that the government reports should be ignored, but the guidance from a bunch of home builders who led the charge in one of the greatest boom bust bubbles in the history should be taken as gospel?

The simple truth of the matter is that the economy is so indebted, that any increase in rates is going to have a big effect.  This new home sales miss is just the first of the collateral damage from this quarter&#8217;s bond rout.
