Although I am long gold (much to my chagrin so far), I am by no means a gold bug. In fact, I find all the &#8220;there is no gold in Fort Knox&#8221; and &#8220;the Federal Reserve is deliberately manipulating gold downward&#8221; conspiracy theories quite tiresome.

These tin foil hat gold bugs actually do the asset a huge disservice by droning on about the evil plans hatched by Central Bankers to drive the price of gold down. In financial markets whenever I hear someone complaining about price manipulation, it generally means that the trade is going against them.

The idea that Central Banks care enough about gold to manipulate it downward is laughable. 

Let&#8217;s imagine for a moment that these conspiracy nut jobs are correct &#8211; the Western Central Banks are deliberately selling gold to drive it lower. Now, let&#8217;s review the worldwide Central Bank gold holdings for a moment:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/213d014acda64ac5734da7f2a3cc0095.jpeg" alt="213d014acda64ac5734da7f2a3cc0095" title="213d014acda64ac5734da7f2a3cc0095.jpeg" border="0" width="376" height="353" />

As you can see, China&#8217;s Central Bank is woefully underinvested in gold. They are steadily increasing their exposure, but if they were to simply increase their holdings from 1.3% to 10%, that would imply that they would have to buy more gold than the US Central Bank holds in total. And that would still keep their reserves at 10% versus most of the other large Central Banks that have many multiples of that. 

Now, let&#8217;s return to the idea that the US Central Bank is deliberately manipulating gold lower. The Chinese are astute cunning traders. Although they might allow the gold to be manipulated lower for a while, eventually they would simply take advantage of the American&#8217;s foolishness in selling their gold. In the long run, gold will go where it wants to go and even the Federal Reserve cannot affect the price for long.

The gold bugs should take a page out of Buffett&#8217;s book. Warren Buffett&#8217;s attitude toward short sellers of his Berkshire stock is a much more healthy attitude to have. Instead of moaning on about how they are driving the price down, he views it as an opportunity to buy his company at an artificially depressed price.

Same thing should be said about gold. If there is downward manipulation, then long term holders should welcome it as an opportunity to buy more at a depressed price.

Instead the gold bugs fill the airwaves with crazy accusations about the conspiracy to keep gold down.

The latest evidence that they are citing is the fact that over the last few weeks, during the early NY trading someone will sell 5,000 contracts in a massive swoop and send the price of gold down $25 at a crack. Since it is sold so poorly, they claim that this is &#8220;proof&#8221; that it is a Central Bank wanted to move the price lower.

I have no idea why someone would sell 5,000 contracts at market, but I do know that when it happens the other way, these gold conspiracy bugs are strangely silent.

That is why I find this morning&#8217;s action quite interesting:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/GOLDGIPOct1713.gif" alt="GOLDGIPOct1713" title="GOLDGIPOct1713.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

Someone sent gold up over $30 for no real reason. Where are the cries of the manipulation to the upside?

Could it maybe just be that this is the way that gold trades and that it is prone to big violent quick moves? Nah… Can&#8217;t be. It must be the Central Banks manipulating it lower &#8211; today&#8217;s action doesn&#8217;t &#8220;count&#8221; as manipulation because it is just returning to its &#8220;fundamental&#8221; value…
