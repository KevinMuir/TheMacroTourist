We are in the midst of a global selloff in fixed income.  It doesn&#8217;t seem to matter if it is US Treasuries, German Bunds, Indian Government bonds or Australian bonds &#8211; they are all getting crushed.

A year ago I was quite negative on the Australian economy due to their exposure to the Chinese boom.  Although I did manage to take a little money out of the market on a short AUD position, as usual, I was much too quick to give up on the position and did not fully capitalize on the large move lower.

Although the AUD is still mired in the muck &#8211; reflecting the continued poor prospects for the Australian economy, over the past couple of months, the Australian bond market has sold off quite aggressively with all the other world bond markets.

I think that this is unjustified given that Australia is still one of the few developed countries with significantly positive over night rates which gives them plenty of room for further cuts.  Most other countries are approaching zero bound and their policy choices are rather limited.  Australia still has almost 250 basis points of room for further easing from the RBA.

Their 10 year bond is yielding 120 basis points more than the US and 130 bps more than their closest contemporary &#8211; Canada.

Given that I think their economy is going to under perform for years to come, I think that eventually the Australian 10 year yield will trade underneath the US and Canadian yield as the RBA is forced to aggressively cut rates due to the popping of the China / resource bubble.

These sorts of bubbles don&#8217;t get cleaned up in a quarter or two.  They take years to be cleansed through the system.  The Australian economy is going to face many years of an uphill battle as they shake off the effects of the China / resource bubble.

This global bond sell off has given us a chance to buy Australian bonds at higher yields and I am going to take advantage.  I am starting my long Australian 10 year bond future position today.
