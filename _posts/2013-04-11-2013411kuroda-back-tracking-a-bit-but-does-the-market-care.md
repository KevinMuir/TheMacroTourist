A couple of days ago Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda told reporters in Tokyo that the Central Bank had taken all &#8216;necessary&#8217; and &#8216;possible&#8217; measures.  The Yen initially sold off hard on the news as it appeared that the BoJ head was backing off on his &#8216;whatever it takes&#8217; attitude.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/JPY%20Intra%20Day%20Apr%2011%2013.jpg" />

However, in a perfect exemple of the markets make the news, not the other way round, the Yen quickly resumed it downtrend and finished at new lows against the USD.  In another market environment this comment might have sent the Yen up 200 pips.  However in this manic Yen bear move, BoJ Kuroda&#8217;s comments managed to stem the decline for all of 10 minutes.

Last night in Japan, Kuroda made more comments along the similar vein:

> BoJ&#8217;s Kuroda says may adjust policy before 2% target reached if economy and other indicators are growing rapidly.

The intention of Kuroda&#8217;s first comments was debatable.  Given the massive Yen bear market it is not surprising that it was interpreted in the most bearish light.  However, the second comment is no longer ambiguous and it **clearly shows that Kuroda is trying to ease up on the gas pedal.**

By saying that he might withdraw stimulus even before the target is reached, Kuroda is trying to slow the pace of the Yen decline and Nikkei rise.  The rate at which the markets were &#8216;adjusting&#8217; was most likely much quicker than the officials originally estimated.

But wasn&#8217;t this what the Japanese government wanted?  Isn&#8217;t the plan working beautifully?

I think the Japanese Governor was rattled for two reasons:

1.  The speed of the decline threatened to cause a self reinforcing feedback loop that might accelerate.  It is one thing for the Yen to sell off 3 USDJPY handles in a week, it is quite another when you are getting that sort of move every day.  The decline threatened to become <span style="color: #111111"><b>disorderly and that prompted the attempts to slow it down.</b></span>

2.  From a geopolitical point of view, the Japanese&#8217;s monetary policy is actively stealing growth from other nations.  The policy might be justified given the Yen&#8217;s two decades of strength, but fixing the problem of two decades in two months would be a little difficult for Japan&#8217;s trading partners to accept.

It is clear that Japan has probably decided that 100 USDJPY is a good rate for the time being and wants to cool things down.

The question is &#8211; are they going to be able to?

The first comments from Kuroda only managed to halt the decline for a few minutes.  There is a chance that the Japanese officials have assumed a level of control that is not realistic.  The devaluation very well could gather steam and become unstoppable.  Don&#8217;t forget, it is easy to send your currency down as you can always make more of it.  However, keeping your currency up is quite another matter.

Although I am aware that the whole process could very well spin out of control, given the market&#8217;s large Yen short position, I think that Kuroda is going to be able to squeeze the weak shorts (at least for a while).

Therefore, I think you should have no short Yen positions, and you can even look at buying some Yen calls.  I will keep the other two slices of my short Japan sandwich &#8211; short Nikkei and short JGBs.

Given Kuroda&#8217;s implicit intent to defend 100 USDJPY, I think the risk reward favours betting that he will be successful in the short term.
