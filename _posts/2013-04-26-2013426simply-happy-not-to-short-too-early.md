This is a very difficult macro environment to trade.  It seems very clear that the world economy is rolling over.  Have a look at the Citibank Economic Surprise Index for the G10:

Over the last two months there has been an obvious dramatic deterioration in the world&#8217;s major economies.

However, at the same time there has been a massive rally in world equity markets.  Have a look at the MSCI World Equity Index over the same period:

Now I understand that bad economic news does not necessarily mean lower stock prices.  In the later stages of an economic cycle, bad economic news often causes rallies in equities as the markets anticipate future easing.   However, in this era of zero interest rates and with 2 of the 3 major Central Banks already expanding the monetary base as much as politically possible, I am at loss to understand how we are going to get a significant increase in monetary easing if the world economy rolls over.

**The markets are not rising in anticipation of future easing, but rather are rising in spite of the economic hiccup as a direct result of the current highly expansionary monetary policy.  **This is a very important distinction.

In a usual cycle, by the time the &#8216;bad economic news is good news for equities&#8217;, the markets have already been going down for some time.  This is definitely not the case this time.  We are sitting at highs for most of the indexes.

The markets have become disconnected from fundamentals and are not trading in the &#8216;usual pattern&#8217; in the least.  You should definitely be weary whenever someone starts blaming the markets for not trading as they &#8216;should&#8217;.  However I am not suggesting that you should blindly fade the markets because they must eventually &#8216;get it&#8217;.

Yes, they will eventually revert to fundamentals, but Keynes was right about how long that can take.  It makes more sense to try to understand why this is happening so that you can be on the lookout for signs that it is changing.

I confess to not immediately understanding the true massiveness of the Japanese QE program.  However, it is now easy to see that its enormous size is rippling through assets markets throughout the globe.  And don&#8217;t forget, the US is still buying $85 billion of Treasuries each month.  It is only in this crazy age of money printing that this fact is so easily forgotten.  Between these two Central Banks the monetary expansion is unprecedented.

This monetary easing is having a predictable effect &#8211; it is causing asset prices to rise.  Even though the fundamentals are deteriorating, the relentless bid under the market continues to push risk assets to overly stretched levels.  We have seen prices disconnect from fundamentals before.  During the dotcom bubble the inmates seemed to be running the asylum.  Ordinary people and many smart money mangers found ways to justify truly insane prices for technology stocks.  There is absolutely nothing stopping a similar bubble from developing today.  In fact, the amount of monetary stimulus that is being thrown at this problem almost guarantees that there is going to be a bubble and it is going to be big.

Therefore, one needs to be extremely weary of market calls that are assuming that the stock market will revert to fundamentals.  Of course in the long run, this will be the case.  However, the long run is a long, long time.

I believe George Soros said something to the effect that when he sees a bubble, he buys it.  That is a tough thing to do, but that is why he is probably best trader that has ever lived.

Markets are disconnected from fundamentals.  There is no denying this fact.  Resisting the temptation to short the market due to its inevitable decline is very, very difficult.

I am going to be happy if I simply don&#8217;t lose too much money by being short too early.
