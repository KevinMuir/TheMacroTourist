The European stock market rally has picked up steam and shows no signs of stopping. &nbsp;The indexes are now up between 2.50% and 3.5% across the board.

At this point, I am wrong and it is time to admit it. &nbsp;It very well could be that I am giving up at the highs, but it feels to me that we have a good possibility of a &#8216;risk on&#8217; melt up across the board.

I am flattening a lot of my &#8216;risk off&#8217; trades and going to watch from the sidelines for a little while. &nbsp;

For those bulls that have called this one right, beware and you might want to trim up into my short covering&#8230;</p>
