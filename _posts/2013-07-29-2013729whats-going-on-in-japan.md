The Nikkei was down big again last night.  This is now two days in a row with big losses.

I am not sure what is going on in Japan, but it has me worried.

Have a look at this chart that shows the S&P 500 vs the Nikkei since Prime Minister Abe has been elected last year:

You will notice that the two indexes have traded in lock step over the last year until the last month.

The divergence between the two is now quite startling.

Now maybe Japan is simply taking a breather and will resume its bull market tomorrow.  Or maybe this relationship is due to breakdown and there is nothing to worry about.

However in my book this is one more worry to put on top of the pile.

I continue to advocate caution.
