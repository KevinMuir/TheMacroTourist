  <p>
    Petrobank (PBG) has long been a favourite of mine to trade. The reason is that over the years, Petrobank has spun out various of their different assets into separate companies. The strategy has been to float a certain portion of their holdings into publicly traded vehicle and then, over time, sell off or distribute the remainder until it is no longer a part of Petrobank. It has thus traded somewhat as a holding company whose value could be calculated and sometimes arbitraged.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However Petrobank is nearing the end of its life as a holding company as it recently announced that it would distribute the last of its publicly traded holdings in Petrobakken (PBN) and then roll the remaining assets into a new Petrobank share structure. This has been long anticipated by the market as it has been a hedge fund favourite to be long PBG and short PBN in an attempt to capture the discount that seemed to perpetually weigh down PBG. Although the discount has narrowed since the announcement, it continues to offer a very attractive risk reward.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Let&#8217;s first go over the mechanics of the trade.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For every share of PBG, an investor will receive between 1.06 and 1.11 shares of PBN. I spoke to the company this afternoon and learned that the variability in the ratio is due to the uncertain nature of how many employee stock options will be exercised between now and the deal closing. The IR representative told me how to go about digging up the information from the quarterly filings to better estimate this ratio.. He strongly hinted that it would most likely be nearer to the higher end of the range. Given that PBG and PBN are both near their relative lows, I am assuming that this means less options will be exercised and therefore the ratio will be higher. For the sake of simplicity, let&#8217;s just use a round number and say for every PBG an investor will receive 1.10 PBN.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now, let&#8217;s have a look at the prices of the two different stocks to calculate the first step of the trade. You can buy PBG at $12.40 and short 1.10 PBN at $11.40. However, before we do that, we need to remember that we are shorting a stock that is pays a dividend. The deal is scheduled to close on December 31st and today I confirmed with the IR representative that the date would not be bumped by a few days to avoid the hassle of the dividend that is due at roughly the same time. He confirmed that the deal would close after the record date of the December dividend. Therefore, you need to subtract two monthly dividends from the PBN share price as you are going to owe them. The dividends are $0.08 a month, so the $11.40 sale price is really a $11.24 effective price after the dividend. That means that you are paying $12.40 &#8211; ( 11.24 * 1.10 ) = $0.04 per share to buy the remaining assets of PBG that will be spun into the new company.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What is that new company worth?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To start with, it will have almost a $1.00 in cash. However, the market doesn&#8217;t really pay a premium for cash (in fact they discount it as management loves to spend it), so what else is in there?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are some conventional oil assets that are valued by a couple of different analysts at between $0.30 and $1.00 per share. There is also a project that uses a technology called THAI that at one time held a lot of hope as a new in situ way to extract oil from deeper oil sands. This science project has been a disappointment and although management still has a lot of hope for the technology (in their presentation they give it a potential value of up to $10 per share), the street has largely given up due to consistently poor performance. But there is some value there, so let&#8217;s go with the Fraser Mack analyst Vic Vallance who assigns a value of $0.30 per share.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What does this add up to? I would argue that the new Petrobank stub is probably worth somewhere between $1.50 and $2.00. However, let&#8217;s assume that it trades poorly due to a lack of sponsorship and merely trades at cash value.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What does that return look like then using these assumptions?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can buy the spread today at $0.04 and unwind it in a month and a half at $1.00.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There is basically no funding costs as it is cash neutral. Assuming $12.40 capital requirement (you need half the long and half the short thus making it 100% of the long), that works out to a 7.6% yield. Not bad for 6 weeks work!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As a straight arbitrage, I think it is great trade.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When I spoke to the company, they indicated that the circular had already been sent off to the printers. I expect that when it is properly filed and the details finalized, the arbs will become more aggressive and the discount will narrow.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I expect that PBG will be well bid in the next few days and that this spread will move up to $0.50 at least:

  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, I also really like PBG as a good long play with a built in positive edge.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you buy PBG without shorting PBN, you are in essence buying PBN at a discount that will be realized in the next couple of months.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now let&#8217;s have a look at the PBN chart:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <img class="aligncenter" title="PBN Nov 20 12.gif" alt="PBN Nov 20 12" src="/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/50c60ed1e4b026203261c1bb/1353449586057/PBN%20Nov%2020%2012.gif/1000w" width="600" height="429" border="0" />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can see that it has had a tough couple of months. Some of this can be attributed to a crappy market, but this sell off seems especially steep.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To judge whether PBN has performed worse than most Bakken oil plays, I have constructed an arbitrary price weighted index of half a dozen similar stocks. Here is the performance of PBN versus that index:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <img class="aligncenter" title="PBN vs BAK Nov 20 12.gif" alt="PBN vs BAK Nov 20 12" src="/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/50c60ed1e4b026203261c1bc/1353449587557/PBN%20vs%20BAK%20Nov%2020%2012.gif/1000w" width="600" height="429" border="0" />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The index is the red line and PBN is the white bars. You will notice that that during the summer PBN seemed to track the index fairly closely. There seemed to be some hype going into September (which was when the announcement of the spin out from PBG occurred) which caused PBN to outperform. But since then PBN has given up all of its gains and has now severely underperformed the average Bakken stock. I believe that some of this is in anticipation of the coming supply from the PBG spin out. The last reporting showed that 7 million shares were sold short in the US and that 11 million were short in Canada. That is almost 20% of the issued stock. <em><strong>I believe that a fair amount of the selling has thus already been done.</strong></em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PBN held the $11 area this summer and so far it looks like that level is once again providing support.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am fairly constructive on the market as a whole as I feel that there is a lot of pessimism built in. Therefore I would suspect that over the next few months any surprises will not be <em>as bad as many participants fear.</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Buying PBG at a $1.00 discount, at a level that has provided support in the past, seems like a great way to express that view.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Alternatively for my bearish brethren, buy the PBG and short the PBN locking in a 7.5% yield for two months work. Sure beats earning 25 basis points in the overnight.
