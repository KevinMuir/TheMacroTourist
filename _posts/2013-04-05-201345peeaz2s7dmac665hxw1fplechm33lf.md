Yesterday I [commented](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2013/4/4/weekly-continuing-claims-just-terrible) that the economic hiccup might be getting a little worse and potentially turning into one of those little &#8216;throw ups&#8217; in your mouth.  Well this morning the monthly employment numbers were released and that economic hiccup has become a lot more like that scene from Bridesmaids when they ate the bad Mexican food.

The numbers were just terrible.  I mean take a dump in the street bad.

Both the US and Canadian employment numbers were released, and they were both complete disasters.

On the US side, they were expecting a 200k increase in the payrolls, instead there was only 95k added.  In Canada, economists were forecasting an increase of 6.5k jobs, but instead there was a massive 54.5k decline!

The stock markets have gotten tagged hard with the S&P down 20 handles this morning.

The US bond market has exploded higher with the 30 year yield breaking to new lows:

I have been very concerned that the North American economy was rolling over.  This morning&#8217;s economic release has most likely brought this concern to the forefront of many other investors who were hoping that it was merely a little blip.

I am also concerned that many investors have reached for risk, and that there really is no ability for the Fed or other Central Banks to backstop a new decline.

In my opinion, the risks are steadily increasing and although I am short, I am still scared.
