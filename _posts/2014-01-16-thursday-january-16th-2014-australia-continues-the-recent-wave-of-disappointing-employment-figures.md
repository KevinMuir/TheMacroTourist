This morning Australia released their employment figures. They weren&#8217;t quite as bad as Canada&#8217;s, but they were definitely on the disappointing side and show that the commodity countries&#8217; woes are continuing.

Economists were expecting 10k jobs to be added in December, but instead 22.6k jobs were lost. The previous months gain of 21k was also revised to only 15.4k.

The foreign exchange traders took this release as the all clear to send the Australian dollar down to new lows for this move:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Australia&#8217;s rates are a long way from zero, so the Reserve Bank of Australia has the quaint ability to actually lower rates into a slow down. Over the last six months rates had been moving up with the global sell off in the major bond markets, but this release has cast a dose of cold water on the idea that the recovery from the commodity slump is going to happen any time soon.

The market has pushed the 1 year Australian Government bond below the 2.50% target rate, so they are beginning to price in an easing from the RBA:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

There can be no denying that the world economy is not as strong as the bulls would like you to believe. Employment seems to be a problem everywhere. There is no decent growth in payrolls anywhere.

The stock markets of the US, Japan and Europe are pushing to new highs, but that pretty well sums up the only thing that the bulls can point to as a sign that the world economy is doing well.

There were hints of hope in the 4th quarter. For example the Baltic Dry Index had pushed upwards after going sideways for all of 2012 and half of 2013. However, the index has collapsed in the first two weeks of this year.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="BDIYJan1614.gif" alt="BDIYJan1614" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/BDIYJan1614.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Baltic Dry Shipping Index</figcaption></figure> 

Some of the pundits more prone to hyperbole are proclaiming the recent weakness in the Baltric Dry Index as the coming of the next great collapse, but they nefariously omit the fact that the index had risen from 750 to 2250 before &#8220;collapsing&#8221; back down to 1375. Please don&#8217;t think that I am predicting some terrible outcome because of this recent dip, but I do wonder if the world economy might be stalling.

Have a look at the world Manufacturing PMIs (from ZeroHedge):<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Apart from the US, UK, Germany and Japan, most other countries are decidedly moribund for this stage in the recovery. The major industrialized countries are steaming ahead, but they are leaving the rest of the world behind.

This phenomenon can best be explained by the fact that whereas for the last decade China was the lead engine of growth that lifted the commodity and emerging market countries higher, China is no longer providing this support.

Now that China is in the process of rebalancing their economy, the world economy is also adjusting to this new composition.

The real question is whether the new economic leaders can continue to power the global economy now that the Chinese engine is throttled down to idle.

And what happens if these new leaders&#8217; economies turn downward? How will the global economy react with no engines firing?

I was listening to James Rickards the other day and he asserted that the Fed was tapering into the next recession. I must admit that although almost all market strategists are very optimistic about global growth, I am not nearly as confident and am somewhat sympathetic to Rickards&#8217; view. The recent employment release disappointments and Baltic Dry Index declines are signs that all is not well.

I urge you to remember the legendary Bob Farrell&#8217;s rule:

**Positions**

**UPDATE: Short S&P 500 into strength.  **Shorted the second half of my position into yesterday&#8217;s ramp.  Although this rally was probably a little more ferocious than I would have predicted, I still believe the risk reward favours the short side.  **We are so close to new highs that you need to steel yourself for the potential breakout, but I am not going to cover into any squeeze and will sit tight into new highs.  I suspect if we do have a break out, it will be a last gasp.  Be ready for a &#8220;pop and drop&#8221;.  **Conviction: 4

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

**Short Canadian dollar.** CAD continues to quietly sink.  Conviction level: 4. Stops to come.  **Short CAD against JPY and EUR.**  Small position size.

**Long various natural gas contracts.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather. Conviction level: 3 No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** I am long bond market volatility as I think the next crisis will start in the bond market. Conviction level: 3.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 6
