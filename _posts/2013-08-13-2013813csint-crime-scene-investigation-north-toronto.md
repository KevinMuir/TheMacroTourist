Remember when I warned you that I am no credit analyst and that any trade that I put on in stock specific bonds is usually driven by a larger macro picture?  Keep that in mind as I tell you about an interesting little play in CSI.NT bonds that I have been accumulating.

Colossus Minerals (CSI CN Equity) is a gold exploration company that was taken to the woodshed a month ago when it announced that the production from its Serra Pelada mine in Brazil would be delayed because of higher than expected water inflow.  The real problem was that the company announced that it was evaluating the &#8220;amount and timing of the additional funds required&#8221; due to the delay.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/520a4496e4b004c7f374cbe2/1376404631498/rick_moranis_ghostbusters_young_18ca8jc-18ca8ng.jpg" />

Given that we are in the midst of one of the greatest bear markets ever experienced by junior mining stocks, this was tantamount to Rick Moranis howling at the moon and giving away that he had become the Keymaster after been bitten by the &#8220;dog&#8221; in one of the greatest movies of all time &#8211; Ghostbusters.

As in Ghostbusters, investors very quickly steered clear of CSI,  just as they steered clear of Rick Moranis.

The stock was quickly halved.

Things looked pretty bleak.

But then our good friends at GMP Securities and Dundee Securities ponied up to the plate and did a bought deal of equity units for total proceeds of almost $38MM.

Since then the stock has basically treaded water.  I am not sure if the stock is a buy and I will leave that to much smarter (and braver) investors than me to figure out

However, this brings me to CSI.NT.  Although I like to joke by referring to this symbol as CSI North Toronto, it actually stands for CSI Note.

The reason it ends with .NT and not .DB is that it is not convertible into the underlying equity like most other Toronto Stock Exchange listed bond issues and has a somewhat unique structure.  What is most interesting is that the coupon is dependant on the price of gold:

> The Notes will mature on December 31, 2016 (the “Maturity Date”) and will bear interest, accruing and calculated and payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 31 of each year, at a rate of between 6% and 13%, dependent on the simple average of the London PM Gold Fixing Price. The Notes will yield 9.0% based on the current London PM Gold Fixing Price. The first interest payment date is December 31, 2011, and will consist of interest accrued from and including the Closing Date calculated in accordance with the simple average of the London PM Gold Fixing Price during the stub interest payment period.

Right now gold is much lower than when they floated this note, so the coupon has moved down into the 6% level.

However, the note has retreated in price and can now be purchase for less than $60.

It did briefly trade down below $50, but that was before GMP and Dundee had done their bought deal.  At that point, there was a lot more risk to the noteholders because the financing shortfall could have been met by issuing more bonds that might be put ahead in the credit structure.  Once the equity deal was done, the bonds rallied because that risk was reduced.

There are a million things that could go wrong with this trade.  If you buy this, you shouldn&#8217;t think about it as a bond/note, but instead should treat it for what it actually is &#8211; a complete small stock speculation in a slightly different structure.

However, if you want to speculate on a Canadian junior mining stock, buying a bond at $55 or $60 whose coupon will increase along with the price of gold seems like a decent play.

Eventually Rick Moranis was cleared of his Keymaster body possession.  I am hoping that as (if) the gold market improves, the CSI.NT will also be cleared of the general junior gold stock worries and the note will drift higher over time.   In the mean time it is earning 10% on a current yield basis.  It pays to wait.
