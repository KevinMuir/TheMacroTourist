I am long the gold miners &#8211; not the greatest trade so far as I am definitely offside in most of my names, but the action over the last few days has encouraged me to add to the trade.

Although I love to poke fun at the &#8220;Legendary Dennis Gartman&#8221;, there is a fair amount of his trading wisdom that I happen to agree with. One of his favourite strategies is to go with a &#8220;gap&#8221; if it holds after 3 days. 

If you recall late last week the relentless NY gold market opening selling that was mysteriously sending gold down $30 on a disturbingly consistent basis finally stopped and reversed with a $40 morning whoosh higher. The gold miner ETF GDX gapped higher that day, and we are now trading for the third day with that gap holding:

I am long, and getting longer the gold miners. 

The group is very unloved, and I think there is a decent chance that last week&#8217;s lows will hold, and the stocks will churn higher.
