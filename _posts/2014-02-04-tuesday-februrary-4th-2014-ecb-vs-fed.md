Yesterday I mentioned that I had put on a short Euro currency position, but didn&#8217;t have time to write it up. Today I am going to go through my reasoning.

I have long held the belief that the ECB is the tightest major Central Bank out there. Whereas the Fed and the Bank of Japan have been expanding their balance sheets like drunken sailors, over the last year, the ECB has been quietly doing the opposite.<figure id="attachment_12601" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-12601" alt="ECBvsFedFeb0314.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/ECBvsFedFeb0314.png" width="600" height="385" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ECBvsFedFeb0314-300x192.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ECBvsFedFeb0314.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/ECBvsFedFeb0314.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">ECB vs Fed Total Balance Sheet (ECB white line &#8211; Fed yellow line)</figcaption></figure> 

At the onset of the 2008 credit crisis, both the Fed and the ECB expanded approximately equally. But by the time of QE2 rolled around, the ECB allowed their balance sheet to stay stagnant while the Fed&#8217;s expanded. This helped exacerbate the European credit crisis and it was not until the height of the panic when Draghi put the pedal to the metal that the vicious deflationary self reinforcing circle was stopped. However, this action came at the cost of an extremely bloated balance sheet. Since the crisis has subsided the ECB has been quietly shrinking their balance sheet.<figure id="attachment_12611" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-12611 " alt="ECBvsFedSTFeb314.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/ECBvsFedSTFeb314.png" width="600" height="384" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ECBvsFedSTFeb314-300x192.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ECBvsFedSTFeb314.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/ECBvsFedSTFeb314.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">ECB vs Fed Total Balance Sheet &#8211; over the last year &#8211; complete opposite directions!</figcaption></figure> 

Many market watchers have been confused as to why the Euro refuses to go down, but I think this graph with the two Central Banks&#8217; balance sheet illustrates the reason quite clearly. It is obviously not quite so simple, but the ECB has been relatively tight when compared to the other major Central Banks. At the margin, they have been encouraging the destruction of credit as opposed to the expansion by the Fed. When credit is destroyed the money supply shrinks and when there is less of something, the value of it rises. Thus the Euro has been rallying.<figure id="attachment_12621" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-12621" alt="EURFeb0314.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/EURFeb0314.png" width="600" height="347" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EURFeb0314-300x173.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EURFeb0314.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/EURFeb0314.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">EUR Currency vs USD</figcaption></figure> 

If you have a look at the relative size of the ECB&#8217;s balance sheet vs the Fed&#8217;s, along with the Euro, you will see that the Euro currency bottomed approximately at the point of maximum relative ECB balance sheet size and that since that ratio has been trending lower, the Euro has been marching higher:<figure id="attachment_12781" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-12781" alt="ECBvsFedFeb04134.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/ECBvsFedFeb04134.png" width="600" height="344" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ECBvsFedFeb04134-300x172.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ECBvsFedFeb04134.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/ECBvsFedFeb04134.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">ECB/Fed Total Balance sheet ratio (white line) vs EUR currency (yellow line)</figcaption></figure> 

So why then am I shorting the Euro?

I think at the margin, the rate of decline between the ECB&#8217;s balance sheet and the Fed&#8217;s has hit maximum steepness. Although I am not sure it is going to be rifling back higher, I think this ratio will very shortly stabilize and become less of a factor in determining the Euro&#8217;s value.

The Fed is on track to methodically wind down QE3. Some market participants might anticipate that the Fed will once again panic and ease up on the taper, but I think that until something big breaks, the route is set. It will take a real disaster to derail the taper train.

And then from the ECB&#8217;s perspective, I think they have hit a point where they can no longer ignore the fundamental problems with their member countries&#8217; economies. Unemployment continues to climb to dangerous levels. Contrast that to the US where it is steadily marching lower:<figure id="attachment_12791" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-12791" alt="USvsEUUnemploymentFeb414.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/USvsEUUnemploymentFeb414.png" width="600" height="384" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/USvsEUUnemploymentFeb414-300x192.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/USvsEUUnemploymentFeb414.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/USvsEUUnemploymentFeb414.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">EU Unemployment Rate (white line) vs US (yellow line)</figcaption></figure> 

This problem has not been made any easier by the ECB&#8217;s tight monetary policies. If anything, the US is too loose and the EU is too tight.

This contrast between their monetary policies needs to be brought back into line.

Mario Draghi claims that inflation expectations are well anchored, but I think there is a whiff of deflationary scare in the air. Have a look at the ECB inflation rate over the last 5 years:<figure id="attachment_12801" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-12801" alt="EUROCPIFeb0414.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/EUROCPIFeb0414.png" width="600" height="385" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EUROCPIFeb0414-300x192.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EUROCPIFeb0414.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/EUROCPIFeb0414.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">EU CPI YoY</figcaption></figure> 

It has been steadily marching lower.

And as for expectations, the German 5 year break even inflation rate is 82 basis points, well below the ECB&#8217;s target:<figure id="attachment_12631" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-12631" alt="German5YBEFeb0314.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/German5YBEFeb0314.png" width="600" height="347" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/German5YBEFeb0314-300x173.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/German5YBEFeb0314.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/German5YBEFeb0314.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">German 5 Year Break Even Rate</figcaption></figure> 

With the global economy rolling over, the high Euro and already elevated unemployment rate, puts the EU in a very precarious spot.

Although I do not think they are about to engage in the same sort of balance sheet expansion we saw during the European credit crisis, I think they will stop allowing their balance sheet to shrink so aggressively.

Also, I suspect that we are about to experience some sort of experiment with negative rates in the EU. Denmark, which has its own currency, already has negative rates, so it won&#8217;t be something completely foreign to the ECB.

This will not be good for the Euro.

The Euro has been rising because the Fed has been extremely aggressive with QE3 and the ECB has been shockingly tight with their balance sheet. The contrast has hit its maximum and is set to resume back to a more normal level. Markets anticipate, so I suspect that the Euro currency will &#8220;figure this out&#8221; and that the Euro currency bears that have been so confused, might finally get their wish and see a lower Euro.

I am short.

**Things I am watching&#8230;**

**A terrible ISM number**

Yesterday the ISM Manufacturing number was released and it was terrible.  About as disappointing as you can get.  For the headline number, the (overly optimistic) economists were expecting 56.0, but instead it came in at a lousy 51.3.<figure id="attachment_12651" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-12651 " alt="ISMManufacturingFeb0314.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/ISMManufacturingFeb0314.png" width="600" height="199" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ISMManufacturingFeb0314-300x99.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ISMManufacturingFeb0314.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/ISMManufacturingFeb0314.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">ISM Manufacturing &#8211; actual number is red, green line is the expected number</figcaption></figure> 

&nbsp;

And it only got worse with the prices paid also stinking up the joint.  This component was suppose to be 54.0, yet even though the economy is rolling over, the prices paid came in at 60.5!<figure id="attachment_12661" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

**Things I am watching cont&#8230;**

**The perfect indicator**

On Friday I covered half of my S&P 500 short and yesterday morning I wrote about how the bulls should take little solace as I all too often cover a position right before the big move.  True to form, the market proceeded to finally crack big time yesterday.  All I can say is imagine the damage that would have occurred if I had covered it all!

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12731" alt="ESCoverFeb0314.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/ESCoverFeb0314.png" width="600" height="386" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ESCoverFeb0314-300x193.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ESCoverFeb0314.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/ESCoverFeb0314.png)

**Positions**

**Short Euro.** On Friday I initiated a short position in the Euro. Conviction 4

**Short S&P 500.    **I covered half of my position on Friday, and although it was still a good trade, let&#8217;s hope I don&#8217;t take off the other half right before the next big dip!  Conviction 2

****Long Yen.****  I also covered half the long Yen position on Friday. I am probably going to cover this next, and before I cover the stock market short.  Ultimately the trend is lower &#8211; this is purely a counter trend trade and I shouldn&#8217;t be too greedy.  Conviction 2

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
