Since the initial excitement generated from the Fairfax tentative bid for Blackberry, the stock has sold off aggressively and has now reached a point where it is trading a full dollar below the $9 USD cash bid.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="BBRYGIPSep2613.gif" alt="BBRYGIPSep2613" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/09/BBRYGIPSep2613.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" />

The hedge funds have long hated this name (it is one of their biggest shorts) and the Prem Watsa bid has done very little to sway them from their negative bias. Before I tell you why I think they are overly pessimistic, let&#8217;s review what I think are their main points:

  * Although Blackberry still has a decent installed base, they have missed the boat on the next generation of phones and operating system. The latest attempt with QNX and the Z10/Q10 was too little too late. They have lost the battle and it will simply be a slow bleed until the company closes its doors. Blackberry is simply unable to compete with Apple/Google/Microsoft.
  * Against this backdrop of a declining business, you have a foolish rich Canadian who is desperately trying to salvage his large (offside) investment.
  * A sense of Canadian pride is also clouding our collective judgement and as Canadians we are determined to make sure Blackberry survives.
  * The Fairfax bid, if you want to call it that, is extremely flimsy. There are a million &#8216;outs&#8217; and it is not binding on Fairfax at all.
  * As a sign of how little faith Fairfax has in this deal, they are not even providing any new equity for the buy out. Prem is simply trying to roll his existing position into a new private entity.
  * The deal is conditional on two main things &#8211; due diligence and financing: 
      * As evidenced by the company&#8217;s recent earning&#8217;s report, the business is floundering quickly. The new phones are a disaster and consumers are leaving Blackberry in droves. Firing half of the staff is probably just the starting point and although it is a step in the right direction, it probably does not address the material weakness in the company&#8217;s fortunes. This will not turn overnight and if Prem wants an &#8216;out&#8217;, the due diligence will most likely provide that &#8216;out&#8217; for him.
      * We are in a period of very loose lending standards, but this is an **extremely risky** buyout. The lending is by no means an easy task. It will again be very easy for Prem to walk away citing an &#8216;inability to secure financing&#8217;.

The general consensus amongst the hedge fund community is that Fairfax&#8217;s Letter of Intent (LOI) is a desperate bluff on Prem&#8217;s part. Judging by the market&#8217;s reaction, they have decided to call his bluff and continue pressuring the stock.

The current sentiment seems to be focusing on all the things that could go _wrong,_ but what about all the things that might go _right?_

I fully acknowledge that these hedge funds make some really good points. However, let&#8217;s review some of the facts on the bullish side of the ledger.

### Valuation

The company has $4.90 in cash per share on the books. Yes, with all the layoffs it will be chewing through this cash faster than Kristie Alley at an all night Denny&#8217;s buffet, but the cash is sitting there for the time being.

The company&#8217;s patent portfolio is worth over $4 a share. Maybe this is over stated a tad, but there is a definite large value for the Blackberry patents.

Various brokers have the service business worth $2 to $4 per share. I am not sure about the valuation on this part of the business. It is very difficult to value because a lot depends on Blackberry&#8217;s long term viability. With the right leader this is worth much more. With bad leadership, this business quickly slides to nil.

And finally, some market analysts assign a value of up to $1 for the QNX operating system. Again it is tough to value. QNX is prevalent in many other markets, but would anyone be interested in buying it for this price is another question.

When you add this all up, you see that the $9 bid is not really that aggressive. In the absence of Blackberry completely imploding, then Fairfax is actually stealing the company.

### Strategic buyers

So far there have been no strategic buyers that have stepped up to the plate. If you are Apple/Google/Microsoft then you are probably content sitting on the sidelines and watching one of your competitors slowly wither away (although there is an argument to be made that Microsoft would benefit most from buying Blackberry but it appears that they have chosen to lay down in bed with Nokia). However, certain parts are worth much more to various strategic buyers. Maybe Prem is aware of these buyers, but due to the investment Canada rules, knows that it will take a Canadian led buyout to carve it up. My buddy mentioned that maybe Facebook would be interested in the BBM (Blackberry Messaging). That makes sense and given&#8217;s Facebook&#8217;s $120 billion market cap, it wouldn&#8217;t be that outrageous to believe that Zuckerburg might use his stock currency to buy this part of the business.

And what about Samsung? They are a massive company whose handset business is very beholden to Google. Wouldn&#8217;t it make sense for them to hedge with a purchase of Blackberry? There are a ton of really great reasons for Samsung to be interested.

Maybe Prem is aware that there are these strategic buyers in the weeds, but they are reluctant to step forward. I know the hedge fund community views Fairfax&#8217;s bid as a sign that no one else is interested, but I am not as confident that a big strategic buyer is simply not playing it cool.

### Prem Watsa

The hedge fund community is portraying Prem as a patriot but foolish investor who is desperately trying to save a doomed company. They are convinced that his ego is getting in the way of his judgement and that this is simply an attempt to salvage a terrible investment. The letter is merely his attempt to bluff out a bidder for his underwater trade.

I will take the other side of this assessment of Prem. Although I acknowledge that not all his calls are stellar (apart from Steve Cohen&#8217;s, whose are?), over the years I have developed a great respect for the Fairfax chairman. I watched as the hedge funds gained up on him and tried to short sell his insurance company into the ground. Instead of rolling over, he fought back and beat them at their own game. I watched as he took the Sick Kids Foundation in which he serves as a special investment advisor to mostly cash in the mid 2000s and saved the hospital hundreds of millions of dollars when the 2008 credit crisis hit. Whenever he has a public deal that I can participate in, I have a good hard look as more often than not, it works out in spades.

It is scary investing alongside Prem as he is a true contrarian. Even though everyone likes to think they are contrarian, by definition, they aren&#8217;t. Buying Fairfax stocks often takes a leap of faith, but based on his track record (and my anedoctal experience of tagging along of some of his deals), I am not willing to go against him.

The argument that he is bidding to simply stop the bleeding on his position is also crap. In a conference call, Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax stated:

> &#8220;there is a tremendous pressure on Blackberry from those with a vested interest in destroying the company.&#8221;

Fairfax rushed their bid because they realized that the company was bleeding at an alarming rate. They needed to stop the bleeding from a Blackberry operating point of view, not from a Fairfax portfolio point of view. Fairfax takes extremely long term views and they are certainly not afraid of a little mark to market risk.

Prem did not bid for the company because his portfolio investment was sagging. He bid for the company because he intends to buy it. I take him at his word and believe him when he says he will get the deal done.

Give me a choice of overly aggressive hedge funds or Prem Watsa, and I will choose Prem Watsa any day of the week.

### Market sentiment

At the last reporting, there was a short position that equaled 32.35% of the float. This is a massive short position and to a large extent, reflects the hedge fund community&#8217;s love of trading Blackberry from the short side.

You have to take your hat off to the shorts &#8211; they certainly have gotten it right so far. However, they might be pushing their luck a little too far this time.

As the letter of intent is non-binding, risk arbitrageurs are not yet really interested in establishing large positions. And given this pending deal, combined with the vastly decaying business, most traditional money managers will also shy away from it.

So we are in this no man&#8217;s land where the hedge fund sentiment can dramatically swing the stock.

I firmly believe that this why the stock has been so weak over the last day &#8211; it is hedge funds pushing on their short bets.

### Conclusion

I am buying Blackberry and making it a core risk arbitrage holding. The odds favour Prem being good for his bid, and as this becomes more evident, the stock should gradually rally towards the $9 level. I also do not rule out a competing bid and believe that $9 will be a floor for the stock on the downside.

It is obviously a stock full of risks &#8211; but I am willing to bet that the market is overly pessimistic.
