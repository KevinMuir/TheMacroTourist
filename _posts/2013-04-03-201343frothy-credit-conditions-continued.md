I wrote a [piece](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2013/2/14/8zhdg5qlr0nsshu3rp0jfgdmkfj5ox) a couple of weeks ago that made some comparisons between the current bubbly credit market and the covenant light period (or convenant free as one of my buddies joked) of 2004-6.

Since then a Federal Reserve Governor has also highlighted this growing trend:

> &#8220;some areas of fixed income &#8211; notably high-yield and leveraged loans &#8211; do seem somewhat frothy,&#8221; &#8211; BIll Dudley NY Federal Reserve Governor

****

Some have labelled this Dudley&#8217;s &#8216;irrational&nbsp;exuberance&#8217; speech as it bears a striking similarity to Greenspan&#8217;s famous 1996 speech about the stock market. &nbsp;However, just as Greenspan&#8217;s speech resulted in no policy change, this speech is also falling on deaf ears as the credit conditions just continue to expand with no change in attitude from the Federal Reserve.

This morning as I sifted through my daily research I was struck by a couple of stories that are indicative of this new reality.

The first was a ZeroHedge summary of a WSJ article about how Goldman Sachs was starting a new unit to buy leveraged loans:

> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has **launched a new specialty finance company to invest in high-risk debt** primarily of U.S. mid-size companies with no credit ratings.

> &#8230; plans to offer shares in the new unit, **Goldman Sachs Liberty Harbor Capital LLC, &#8220;as soon as practicable** after the effective date of this registration statement.&#8221;

> &#8230; the group has &#8220;**elected to be regulated as a business development company** under the Investment Company Act of 1940.&#8221;

> Goldman said it expects the new unit **will not fall be covered under the so-called Volcker Rule**, which was is part of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul.

> The unit does **qualify as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act** of 2012, known as the JOBS Act, which could allow it to &#8220;take advantage of **specified reduced reporting** and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies,&#8221; said Goldman in the filing.

> Goldman said its investment advisor Goldman Sachs Asset Management L.P. and its management, which will earn incentive fees based on their performance, **&#8220;have no prior experience managing a BDC.&#8221;**

Goldman Sachs creating a new vehicle for investors that will own &#8216;high risk debt primarily of US mid sized companies with no credit ratings.&#8217; &nbsp;I am sure that this will not be the debt of any Goldman Sach&#8217;s investment banking clients, nor the debt that Goldman currently holds on its balance sheet that they are looking to get rid of after a monster rally in leveraged loans. &nbsp;Goldman is just trying to help out yield starved investors with the formation of this company. &nbsp;Right&#8230;. &nbsp;Just like they helped out on the CDO market in 2006.

Then I was struck by another story that was a little closer to home. &nbsp;This story appeared in the Globe and Mail:

> Brookfield Asset Management has always loved turnarounds and other messy situations, and now it has $1-billion (U.S.) more to put to work investing in them.

> Brookfield just closed Brookfield Capital Partners III, which is the biggest fund raised in Canada since 2010. According to peHUB Canada, which first reported the story [here](http://www.pehub.com/193312/do-not-publish-brookfield-sets-out-invest-fresh-1b-fund/), the investors are mostly institutions with participation from Europe. About $250-million came from Brookfield.

> It’s been about seven years since Brookfield raised a special situations fund. The company’s first two [funds](http://www.brookfield.com/_Global/1/documents/relatedlinks/2975.pdf) invested $1.6-billion in 15 companies, with big wins in situations such as the restructuring of steel maker Stelco Inc. It has also gotten into oil and gas business, well services, lumber, paper and bathtubs.

Looks like a rather innocuous story. &nbsp;However did you catch the last paragraph? &nbsp;Did you see the line, &#8216;it&#8217;s been about seven years since Brookfield raised a special situation fund?&#8217; &nbsp;Hmmmm&#8230;. &nbsp;Seven years ago&#8230; that would be right around&#8230;. &nbsp;2006&#8230;. &nbsp;

Gee I wonder how that fund turned out?</p></p>
