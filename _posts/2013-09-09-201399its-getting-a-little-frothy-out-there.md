> &#8220;<span style="line-height: 1.6em">There is a fine line separating savvy contrary thought and a reckless fight with markets. Remember, the crowd is what drives the price action, and you want to ride them until they turn into an unthinking mob.&#8221; &#8211; Barry Ritholz</span>

Although most stock indexes are still off their highs, I am beginning to detect a certain amount of reckless speculation in certain areas of the market.  It is not at the level of the 1990s DotCom bubble or the 2000s real estate madness, but it is building.

I am not suggesting that it is time to go with an all in bet against stocks, in fact, I am actually quite concerned that it very well might get even frothier before it is over.  I have seen George Soros&#8217; technique of **&#8220;when I see a bubble I buy it because I know it will most likely get bigger before it pops&#8221;** play out way too many times.

However, I am definitely a proponent of Warren Buffet&#8217;s advice that:

> &#8220;The less prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we should conduct our own affairs.&#8221;

When I see wise old sages like Oaktree&#8217;s Howard Marks advocating caution due to the increased amount of investor enthusiasm, I know it is not time to be loading up on stocks.

And when I see stocks like Facebook, Tesla and Amazon rocketing to new highs on more euphoria and hope than actual results, I know the animal spirits are running quite high.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; I understand the bull&#8217;s argument for these stocks.  A year ago, I even predicted that Tesla was an ideal candidate for a bubble type valuation (although as typical to my trading, I got nervous after the first $10 and missed the next $110.)

However, these stocks have become objects of speculation that don&#8217;t really reflect any sound reality.  I am especially concerned when I see tweets from traders riding the wave into new highs that don&#8217;t seem to be at all worried about the potential for sharp losses.  Or when I read newsletter writers&#8217; opinion about why Tesla or Facebook is &#8216;different&#8217; than other stocks and therefore valuation doesn&#8217;t matter.

Don&#8217;t ever forget legendary Bob Farrell&#8217;s third rule:

> 3. There are no new eras — excesses are never permanent

&nbsp;

There are not really any actionable trades from this post except for a warning for those that are loading up on these new era stocks &#8211; be careful!  I know you will not listen to me, but I am worried about the frothiness of the market.

Have a look at the charts of these stocks and then ask yourself whether you have truly figured out something ahead of the crowd:

And then for a little more food for thought, I will leave you with another one of my favourite quotes:

> Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist&#8221;. – Economist Kenneth Boulding
