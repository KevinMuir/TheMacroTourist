Of late, I have been somewhat concerned about the crowded nature of the JPY short trade.  It seems like everyone and their dog is short Yen.  It has been extremely easy money and the only people who seem stupid were those (like me) that worried that it had moved too far too fast.

I recently read in one of my market newsletters that the writer felt that this was a &#8216;life changing trade&#8217;.  Although I do think it is a big &#8216;watershed trade&#8217; (as Dennis Gartman likes to say), I am concerned that the froth has gotten way too thick.  Anytime someone who is up size on a trade starts talking this confidently, I immediately worry that the Market Gods might be listening.

I also recently read this WSJ article that highlights the increased FX trading by retail investors using their credit cards as capital!:

> Retail investors are behind about $380 billion a day in foreign-exchange trading volumes, nearly 10% of the total worldwide, according to Aite Group, a consultant.

> One investor is Carl Young, a wireless-communications salesman in Knoxville, Tenn. Mr. Young recently used a credit card to fund his accounts with FXDD and Forex.com, when he was expecting a big paycheck from his work.

> He said he would probably trade less if he couldn&#8217;t use credit cards.

> &#8220;If I know I have [money] coming to me next month, guaranteed, I want to use it now,&#8221; Mr. Young said. He said he made profits from the trades he completed before receiving his paycheck, then paid off the credit card in full. &#8220;It&#8217;s a convenience.&#8221;

I might be wrong, but my guess is that the Carl Youngs&#8217; of the world are most likely short Yen.

Although I fully acknowledge that I am the ultimate Macro Tourist, wandering into trades that I probably shouldn&#8217;t be touching because of a lack of true understanding, this new breed of visitors to the Japanese Yen short trade scares even me!

Have a look at the CFTC&#8217;s Commitment of Traders report for non-commercial short positions:

There is a monster amount of speculative shorts in the market.  And this graph above is not even including the Carl Young&#8217;s of the world who are borrowing on their credit cards to short in the FX market.

I had expressed concern that the G20 meeting would be used to temper down the recent Yen devaluation.  Last night it appeared as if I was absolutely incorrect as the G20 seemed to endorse the Japanese policy:

> &#8220;We, the G7 Ministers and Governors, reaffirm our longstanding commitment to market determined exchange rates and to consult closely in regard to actions in foreign exchange markets. We reaffirm that our fiscal and monetary policies have been and will remain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments, and that we will not target exchange rates. We are agreed that excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We will continue to consult closely on exchange markets and cooperate as appropriate.&#8221;

The markets seemed to be given the further all clear when the US Treasury Undersecretary Lael Brainard told reporters that the US supported Japan&#8217;s attempt to &#8216;reinvigorate growth&#8217; while cautioning all countries against competitive devaluations.  This led market participants to believe that Japan was going to be &#8216;allowed&#8217; to devalue, while everyone else was forced to sit on their hands.  The USDJPY spiked to new highs on all of this news.  The comments emboldened market participants to keep shooting at the Yen.

Until this morning&#8230;

A headline has just crossed that an official from the G7 nations has said:

> &#8230;that the group&#8217;s statement on exchange rates was misinterpreted.  The official, who requested not to be further identified, said the G7 statement signaled concern about excess moves in the Yen.  The G7 is concerned about unilateral guidance on the Yen and Japan will be in the spot light at the G20 in Moscow this week-end.

The Yen has very quickly moved higher on the news:

We now have a situation where the officials have clearly expressed that the Yen has gone too far too fast.  This is also combined with a very over stretched speculative community short position.  The ingredients for a massive short squeeze are there.

There is always a chance that the bad news overwhelms the Yen.  The Japanese economy is truly a long term mess and the Yen does not deserve to be anywhere near 93.75 &#8211; 100 or even 125 is much more realistic.  The market might sense this and simply steam roller any attempt to slow down the ascent.  I understand that.

However, at the same time, I think the risk reward now favours a small long position in the Yen.  This is truly catching a falling knife, no make that a sword, but for the first time in a long time, I not only don&#8217;t feel bad for being flat on the Yen, but am thinking that the risk reward actually favours the other side of the trade.

This is a very volatile period for the Yen.  I will not dig my heels in, but I am trying a Yen long position for a day or two.
