As I sit on the fence, trying to figure out if the recent economic weakness in developed markets is really just a weather related blip, or the start of something more sinister, I find myself without many concrete views of where we are heading. Sure I have a few trades that I believe in, but as for the bigger direction of where the economy is headed, I am much more torn.

So today I am going to just present some charts that I am watching.

**Does the market have faith in the Fed&#8217;s forward guidance?**

After the first tapering, the markets actually sold off the front end of the curve, refusing to believe the Fed&#8217;s mantra that &#8220;tapering was not tightening.&#8221; This is best illustrated by the decline the in the December 2015 Fed Funds futures contract.<figure id="attachment_14051" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-14051" alt="FFZ5Feb1214.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/FFZ5Feb1214.png" width="600" height="384" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/FFZ5Feb1214-300x192.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/FFZ5Feb1214.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/FFZ5Feb1214.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fed Funds Dec 2015 contract: a lower price signifies a higher rate</figcaption></figure> 

The move lower after tapering was definitely not welcomed by the Fed, but they have since managed to convince the market that they were good for their forward guidance and the market has rallied back to pre-tapering levels.

**Or was the rally in the short end of the curve the result of the weak numbers?**

The Fed&#8217;s job of convincing the market about their forward guidance has been made a lot easier with the poor macro economic numbers that have been trickling out. If you look at Citibank&#8217;s Economic Surprise index which measures the degree to which the macro economic releases are differing from expectations, you will notice that the US economic results have been consistently trending lower in terms of expectations.<figure id="attachment_14061" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

**But what is really strange is that the Emerging Markets economic surprise index is trending higher.**<figure id="attachment_14091" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Could it be that economists are too bearish on how bad things are in the Emerging Markets?<figure id="attachment_14101" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

**If so, I want to buy Mexico.**

[Remember Jim O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s MINT presentation?](http://gfbblogs.azurewebsites.net/blog/2014/01/22/wednesday-january-22-2014-mint-countries-the-next-brics/)

I speculated at the time that it was too early to buy into Jim&#8217;s group of the next BRIC countries, but when I did, I was most partial to the Mexico story. I continue to watch Mexico closely and am becoming more convinced that it has a good chance of being a great long trade.

The Mexico Peso actually did not go down much at all during this mini-EM crisis.<figure id="attachment_14111" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img class="size-full wp-image-14111" alt="MXNFeb1214.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/MXNFeb1214.png" width="600" height="343" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MXNFeb1214-300x171.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MXNFeb1214.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Mexican Peso</figcaption></figure> 

This in contrast to the MINT currencies that have been having a tough ride over the last year. Here is the basket of MINT currencies.<figure id="attachment_14121" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I am tossing around the idea of going long the Mexican Bolsa.<figure id="attachment_14131" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

**And finally, the Max Keiser bottom is still holding!**

I know you are all on the edge of your seat as to whether the Max Keiser bottom is still holding. [As you may recall](http://gfbblogs.azurewebsites.net/blog/2013/12/04/the-max-keiser-precious-metal-bottom/), Max predicted with 100% surety that BitCoin&#8217;s market cap would eclipse that of Silver&#8217;s. Max didn&#8217;t simply think that there was a chance that this might happen. Nor was he merely highly confident. No, Max knew with 100% surety that this would happen!

Let&#8217;s have a look at silver first.<figure id="attachment_14181" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-14181" alt="SILVFeb1214.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/SILVFeb1214.png" width="600" height="382" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/SILVFeb1214-300x191.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/SILVFeb1214.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/SILVFeb1214.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The price of silver since the Max Keiser bottom</figcaption></figure> 

Some scary moments where it looked like the Max Keiser bottom would not hold, but so far it has never closed below the level where he made his proclamation.

And as for Bitcoin&#8230;<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="BTCFeb1214.jpg" alt="BTCFeb1214" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/BTCFeb1214.jpg" width="600" height="276" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price &#8211; not doing so well since Max&#8217;s prediction</figcaption></figure> 

Well, things are not looking so good there. But for those of you that believe Bitcoin will surpass the precious metals as the true store of value, don&#8217;t worry about this dip, take comfort in the fact that Max is 100% sure.

**Positions**

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index vs Long S&P 500.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities.   **On Friday I turned this into a spread trade by buying S&P 500 futures on the other side.  There is no longer any delta associated with the position and it is purely a relative performance trade.  **Conviction 5

**Short Euro.  **Not much to say, I didn&#8217;t enter this trade very well, but I still think the Euro works it way lower in coming months. Conviction 4

****Short Yen.****  Establish short Yen last week.  Now I will sit tight and wait.  Conviction 4

**Short JGB futures.  **I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
