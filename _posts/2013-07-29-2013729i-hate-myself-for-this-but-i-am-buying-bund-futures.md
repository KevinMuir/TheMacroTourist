I hate buying assets that are trading with very little fundamental cushion in the hope that a stretched valuation will become more stretched.

So I hate myself for executing the following trade as in the absence of a further deterioration of the European economy, it will be very difficult for this trade to be a winner.

I am buying German bund futures, betting that although German yields are significantly lower than most of the rest of the developed world, they will become even &#8216;richer&#8217;.

With last month&#8217;s global back up in yields the German 10 year yield rose from 1.25% to 1.86%.  As things settled down, the yield sunk back down to 1.50%, but over the last week it has has returned to the break out level of 1.67%.

I am not a huge technical trader, but one thing that I love is a failed signal.  When yields broke out to new highs, there must have been a lot of a trend followers that jumped on that band wagon.  However, this signal quickly failed and prices retreated right back into the range.  To me this says that the trend is still down.

Given that we are now pushing right back up at that break out level, I think going long bund futures (short rates) is a good risk reward trade.  I will buy using a 3 day hold above the break out level as a stop.

I hate myself for this&#8230;
