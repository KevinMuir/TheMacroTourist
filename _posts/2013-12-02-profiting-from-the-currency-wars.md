What is that line that Pablo Picasso said about artists? Something about good artists copy, but great artists steal?

I for one think that Pablo was on to something and I am not above taking someone&#8217;s great idea and running with it. 

The other day the Sober Look blog posted a piece about a JP Morgan study that examined the excess return earned by following a simple strategy of buying the stock indexes of countries with the weakest currencies and shorting those with the strongest [LINK](http://soberlook.com/2013/10/this-simple-trading-strategy-points-to.html). 

Although in the post Sober Look said not to try this at home, I was intrigued with the strategy and summoning my inner Reagan, I decided to trust but yet verify. I was concerned that all the big alpha might be from trading in countries where I would be unable to execute. It doesn&#8217;t help me if most of the pickup is made by shorting Vietnamese stocks or by buying Turkish stocks as there would be no way I could trade those countries. So we decided to reproduce the study using our own data for only countries with active futures markets were we could transact.

We decided to use the following countries; UK, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Taiwan, Korea, India, Singapore, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Russia and Canada.

Our study was not perfect in that we did not account for carrying costs, but we believe that these costs would be pretty minor compared to the significant alpha that we managed to generate.

Here is the strategy&#8217;s return over the last decade:

You will notice that although we were not able to achieve as high of an excess alpha as JP Morgan, considering that our version only included major liquid markets, it is nonetheless a really great strategy.

I have decided to implement this strategy and will be rebalancing it as dictated by the rules that the JP Morgan&#8217;s analyst created. I will update it on the first of every month and will use the TAG &#8220;Currency Wars&#8221; in case you want to search for it.

I believe that in this day and age of competing Central Banks this sort of beggar thy neighbour aggressive monetary expansion strategy is going to continue to drive financial markets. This system will hopefully be able to capture the ongoing covert &#8220;currency wars.&#8221;

It is no surprise that this strategy actually went sideways until the third quarter of 2008. It wasn&#8217;t until the credit crisis hit that Central Banks began to engage in this aggressive behaviour. At that point the currency wars started with the introduction of the numerous QE programs and since then the strategy has been chugging higher. The strategy has gone a long way without a pause, and with my implementing the strategy, I am pretty well ensuring that one will start shortly, but I don&#8217;t want to wait as I view this as a long term winner.

This month&#8217;s longs are Japan and Canada, while the shorts are the UK and India. I am putting the positions on and will report back at the beginning of next month.
