Most people probably don&#8217;t know who Jake Houseman is, but in my mind, he is one of the great philosophers of the 20th century.

Jake Houseman was Baby&#8217;s Dad in Dirty Dancing and during the famous &#8216;nobody puts Baby in a corner&#8217; scene, he pulled Johnny aside to tell him that he was wrong in thinking Johnny was no good.

&#8216;When I am wrong, I say I am wrong&#8217;&#8230;

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/51ee5837e4b053d3fee55c3a/1374574649184/265122-dd20_img_15%20Jul%2023%2013.jpg" />

I think Jake Houseman would have made a good trader.

So in my quest to live my life more like Jake Houseman, I am going to fess up to making a big mistake in my Blackberry long position.

While I was away on vacation BBRY announced their earnings and they were terrible.  Just gawd-awful.

Most importantly, the amount of new Z10 and Q10 phones that Blackberry sold was below expectations.  Given that I was anticipating a huge back log of keyboard loving Blackberry users to rush out to buy the new Q10 this was especially disturbing.

The phones are simply not getting any traction.  In fact Business Insider recently reported that last quarter BBRY shipped 2.7 million phones while Nokia shipped 7.4 million Windows phone.

My whole theory that Blackberry was the solid third runner after Apple and Android all of a sudden looks incorrect.

Not only that, Ryan who works with me on the technology side is reporting that the developers are slowly accepting Windows phone and getting some success from writing apps for that platform.  Ryan was prescient in being ahead of previous trends in the smart phone industry through his monitoring of developer forums, so I give what he says a lot of credence.

I should have actually known better as for my month long vacation in UK I bought a Z10.  At first I thought it was a solid phone, but then as I used it the old Blackberry annoyances and bugs quickly appeared.  Within two days of using it I wanted to throw it out the window.

I unfortunately did not follow through (with either selling my stock or throwing the phone out the window), as I thought that Q10 users would overwhelm any short term issues that I was having.

Well, I was wrong.  Obviously people are abandoning the Blackberry platform.  It seems to be dying a slow death and I have now sold all of my shares.  As a Canadian I really hope I am wrong, but any Blackberry turnaround success will be accomplished without me as a shareholder.
