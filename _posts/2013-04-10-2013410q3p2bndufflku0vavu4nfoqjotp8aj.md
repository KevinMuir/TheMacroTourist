One of the hedge fund managers that I respect is the most is Kyle Bass.  The other day during an interview he expressed some bewilderment about gold&#8217;s poor performance during the last couple of months.  I too have been somewhat surprised that during the whole Cyprus crisis and the ensuing the Japanese &#8216;Krugman gone mad&#8217; experiment, that gold has been such a poor performer.  I guess all the uncertainty and printing is forcing all investors into Bitcoins:

Joking aside, gold&#8217;s performance has been truly terrible:

The trend is firmly downward with no signs of abating.

It is one thing to be not participating in the current &#8216;risk on&#8217; rally, but it is quite another to be hitting new lows on a regular basis.

With the S&P 500 rocketing to new highs, this is obviously causing a massive underperformance of gold versus financial assets:

As you may recall, I was stopped out on this spread at 1.00.  Upon covering it did indeed bounce (of course), but since then it has drifted back lower.  I am flat, wanting to get long, but also confused as to why gold is performing _so badly._

One obvious reason for gold&#8217;s poor performance is the fact that US dollar is rallying so strongly (especially against the Yen).  Have a look at the chart of Gold priced in Yen &#8211; it is a much different chart:

This explains a fair bit of the gold poor trading, but in my opinion gold is suffering from active selling as opposed to simply a lack of buying.

I have long held the thesis that hedge funds were much too over exposed to gold.  Over the last few years, at the top of the sumaries of hedge fund top holdings, right after Apple, it was always GLD.  To some degree this recent selling is most likely hedge funds reducing their exposure.

It is now made worse that many research houses and hedge funds have been advocating precious metal _short sales.  _Last week SocGen issued the first sell recommendation on gold that I can remember in probably a decade.  It was followed up today with Goldman Sach&#8217;s $1375 target and sell stamp.  I also notice that many of the sentiment indicators about GLD holdings, precious metal closed end fund premiums and CFTC open interest have flipped from overly bullish during the last few years, to increasingly bearish.  The fact that investors are becoming increasingly bearish does not worry me, in fact I would say it is probably a necessary condition for a bottom.  However as the selling continues it is difficult to stand in there and catch the falling knife.****

I am not going to buy any gold for now, but I would much rather be on the other side of the Goldman Sach&#8217;s research piece any day of the week.  The long standing joke is that they use the research pieces to establish their proprietary positions and what really makes this funny is that it proves true all too often!

However, I would really like to see a complete wash out.  Some real climatic selling type event.  Something that makes even KingWorldNews doubt the long term legitimacy of the position.  Don&#8217;t forget that gold has been in a bull market for over a decade, with very few corrections.  It could correct many hundreds of dollars and still be in a bull market.

For now, I am going to use the next support level on the Gold / S&P 500 spread to establish a position:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/GLD%20SPX%20LT%20Apr%2010%2013.gif" />

I would like to see 0.92 on the spread before I wander in again.

Although I think gold is increasingly desirable asset in a world of overnight bank deposit confiscations and insane money printing, right now the selling is overwhelming and there is no sense trying to catch a bottom until a clearer technical sign is presented.  Now maybe there won&#8217;t be this sort of climax, and my refusal to buy again will mark the bottom of the gold market, but for now I am going to sit on the sidelines.

Wednesday April 10th, 2013 &#8211; lunch time update

Thank goodness I listened to myself and skipped trying to catch this knife!  Gold has gone no bid while S&P is shooting straight up!

At this rate, we might be at my initiating target sooner than I thought!
