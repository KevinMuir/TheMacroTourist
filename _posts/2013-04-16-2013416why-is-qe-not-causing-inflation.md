I cam across this really interesting [blog post](http://pragcap.com/misunderstanding-the-monetary-system-is-hazardous-to-your-portfolio) at Pragmatic Capitalism where the author asserts the following:

> Anyone who understands MR and really understands [<span class="s1"><strong>how the monetary system works</strong></span>](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1905625) would never assume that QE is inflationary.  I’ve been on record for years explaining how QE is essentially just an asset swap that changes the composition of private sector financial assets, but doesn’t actually increase the net financial assets of the private sector.  This is the crucial understanding with regards to QE.

> All the other stuff might have some impact.  Yes, QE probably has some impact on interest rates.  It definitely has a psychological impact because it’s so widely misunderstood.  But the one thing it definitely doesn’t seem to do is cause inflation.  And that makes complete sense.  If you own a T-Bond you have something very similar to a savings account.  If the government comes along and takes your savings account from you and replaces it with a bank deposit (a checking account) are you suddenly more inclined to spend?  Of course not.  That’s QE in a nut shell.

> Anyone who understands MR knows that QE (as is being implemented) is overrated when it comes to real fundamental economic impacts.  All the hyperbole in recent years about hyperinflation, high inflation, the increasing money supply all leading to the “overweight hard assets” thesis has been based on a fundamentally flawed understanding of the monetary system.  And now those investors are paying the price.

I don&#8217;t agree with the author, but he made some interesting points that got me thinking.

The major reason that QE has failed to create inflation is that any increase in the the monetary base has been accompanied by a fall in the velocity of money:

The real question is whether the QE policy is actually causing the velocity of money to fall or whether it is the only thing saving our economy from a 1930s style depression.  There are simply too many factors to ever be able to come to a concrete conclusion.  Also, the fact that our attitudes about the policy can actually affect the outcome makes it all the more difficult to isolate.

However, one thing is for sure, the QE money is not getting into the system:

The money that the Fed is injecting into the economy is simply sitting in the form of Treasury Bills and Bonds on bank balance sheets.

Although QE is enabling the Federal Reserve to fund the government&#8217;s mounting debt at absurdly low rates, it is not having the desired affect of making the banks actually write some loans:

This graph that shows JP Morgan&#8217;s total amount of loans (blue bars) versus their deposits (red bars) highlights this problem.

Over the last four years, there has basically been zero loan growth.

No wonder there is no inflation.  There is simply no loans being written.

Which brings us to the obvious question &#8211; why not?

I am not sure if it is a lack of demand or a lack of supply.  Like most things in life, the answer probably lies somewhere in the middle.  After the 2008 credit crisis and the ensuing increase in capital requirements from the third Basel Accord, banks are definitely less eager to lend.  But it isn&#8217;t only banks that are holding back the economy, the consumer is in terrible shape and was quite rightly scared by the last 5 years.  They are also in no mood to increase their borrowing.  With demographics and their terrible balance sheet working against the economy, I am not sure whether banks should be lending to them anyway.

So what is a Federal Reserve to do?

If something doesn&#8217;t work, then simply add a couple of zeros and do more of it of course!

Although the Pragmatic Capitalist author believes that QE will not cause inflation, I believe that it is a very dangerous policy and that he has made a lot of assumptions that can&#8217;t be easily unwound.

However I do agree that if there are no new loans being made, then the effects of QE is extremely limited.

At this point you are probably saying to yourself, &#8216;great &#8211; but what does that mean for my trading?&#8217;

I don&#8217;t have any grandiose conclusions to draw from this analysis.  But I do want to point out that QE is not necessarily inflationary &#8211; especially in the short run.  I do believe that ultimately the velocity of money will stop going down and that point any more QE would be directly expanding the money supply, but that might not be today.

I am also worried that if for some reasons the &#8216;animal spirits&#8217; are once again rekindled, the fact that the monetary base is so astronomically huge, inflation could very well explode upwards.

But if we instead go through a deflationary episode in the coming quarters, I just wanted you to understand that the bottleneck is in the fact with the lack of credit expansion.  You can bring the horse to water, but you can&#8217;t force him to drink.
