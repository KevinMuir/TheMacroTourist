Friday after the market closed, the Canadian government gave the final clearance for both the purchase of Progress Energy by Petronas, and Nexen by CNOCC, to proceed. 

Obviously this decision will be welcome news by the risk arbitrage community who were heavily long both deals.

At the same time, the government also issued guidance for future takeovers in the oil sands. The Canadian government clearly laid out the fact there will be different rules for SOEs (State Owned Enterprises). I think that Harper&#8217;s following remark sums up this point best: &#8220;To be blunt, Canadians have not spent years reducing the ownership of sectors of the economy by our own governments, only to see them bought and controlled by foreign governments instead.&#8221; 

The Foreign Exchange market has reacted quite favourably to this decision. The Canadian dollar immediately rallied:

The stock market is not yet open, so we don&#8217;t yet know how the equity traders will react. 

NXY and PRQ are obviously going to rally quite substantially, but what does it mean for the rest of the market?

If the Canadian government had simply allowed the deals to be completed without any changes to the criteria for evaluating future deals, then I would have argued that it would have created an Animal House style food fight in the Canadian energy arena. 

However, the fact that Harper quite reasonably thread the needle between balancing the need for capital while protecting our Canadian interests means that we are not about to auction off our energy assets. This will temper the enthusiasm for bidding up Canadian energy assets in anticipation of selling them to foreign purchasers later down the road.

Therefore, I think the only real effect is going to be the fact that NXY and PRQ capital will need to be reallocated once the deal is completed. NXY has a market cap of more than $14 billion and PRQ is a little over $5 billion. This means that there is a little less than $20 billion dollars that will need to be reinvested.

The real question is, who owned these two stocks and where will that money go? 

I believe that a fair bit of the two stocks were held by risk arbitrageurs. These funds will not necessarily invest in more Canadian deals as they were simply attracted to the unique risk reward profile of these deals. That money will therefore not find its way into other Canadian oil patch stocks.

The rest of the stock is mostly likely held by fundamental accounts who did not sell on the announcement of the deal, or indexers who will not sell into the deal is completed.

Both of these types of accounts will reinvest the proceeds into Canadian energy names.

However, this will not be done immediately. 

It will take some time and apart from the rally in PRQ and NXY shares, I think there will be very little immediate pop in the energy sector.

Given the market&#8217;s enthusiasm, I think you should be selling into any rallies as this announcement is not quite as bullish as many are anticipating.
