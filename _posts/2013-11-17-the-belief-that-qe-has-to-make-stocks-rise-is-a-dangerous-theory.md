This last week the market was as single-mindedly focused as a 14 year old boy discovering Kate Upton photos on the internet for the first time.

Only one thing mattered and that was Federal Reserve Chairwoman in waiting, Janet Yellen&#8217;s testimony in front of the Senate.

Although there were actually some fairly large boulders lobbed into the bull&#8217;s camp (Cisco&#8217;s terrible guidance, a few different economic releases that showed the slowdown is gaining momentum, Fed Governor Lockhart&#8217;s December taper possibility statement), these were all shrugged off as inconsequential compared to the extremely dovish testimony of Dr Yellen.

The market exploded straight upward as soon as it became clear that Yellen was not going to change her dovish stripes just to get confirmed (something the market feared).

Markets were overjoyed that they had somehow managed to find someone even more dovish than Helicopter Ben and Easy Al. 

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/20131114_Yellen1.jpg" alt="20131114 Yellen1" title="20131114_Yellen1.jpg" border="0" width="349" height="355" />

Although a few Senators asked a few polite pointed questions about the potential nightmare of unwinding the Fed&#8217;s disturbingly large balance sheet, for the most part, they treated her with respect and signalled that they were going to give her the benefit of the doubt and allow her to do it her way. For her part, Yellen stuck to her script and repeatedly reassured the Senators that although she didn&#8217;t want to be engaged in Quantitative Easing, the quickest and surest way to a more normal monetary policy was to ensure a robust recovery through these extraordinary measures. 

> We have made good progress, but we have farther to go to regain the ground lost in the crisis and the recession. Unemployment is down from a peak of 10 percent, but at 7.3 percent in October, it is still too high, reflecting a labor market and economy performing far short of their potential. At the same time, inflation has been running below the Federal Reserve&#8217;s goal of 2 percent and is expected to continue to do so for some time.
> 
> For these reasons, the Federal Reserve is using its monetary policy tools to promote a more robust recovery. A strong recovery will ultimately enable the Fed to reduce its monetary accommodation and reliance on unconventional policy tools such as asset purchases. I believe that supporting the recovery today is the surest path to returning to a more normal approach to monetary policy.

Although I understand how the Fed is the most important piece of the investment puzzle, the markets have become downright irrational with their myopic focus on Quantitative Easing. 

There can be no doubt that QE affects the stock market. There is simply too much evidence, such as the outperformance of the S&P on days where the Fed executes POMO purchases, to doubt otherwise. 

**The question is no longer _whether the QE affects the stock market,_ but rather will this relationship continue going forward?**

The belief that QE _**has** to make the stock market go up,_ is a dangerous theory. 

QE is indeed pushing investors out the risk curve, and to some degree, it has become a self fulfilling virtuous circle. However, as the price of the stock market gets more separated from the natural fundamental level that it would trade at absent QE, it becomes more and more likely that an accident could occur and more likely that any purchases from these lofty levels will be losing trades for some time to come.

In the hearing Yellen was asked about the possibility that bubbles were forming. She steadfastly refused to admit that any bubbles were forming, and reassured us that if they were to form, she would be vigilant in arresting the speculation as the last thing the Fed wants is another repeat of 2008.

Remember, Bernanke gave us the same sort of reassurances about the sub-prime bubble. Greenspan also mouthed similar type words about the stock market in 1999. 

Yellen is confident that there are no bubbles, but I am not so sure.

There is a lot of controversy in using the word _bubble_. By using the actual term bubble, it gives the &#8220;QE is great&#8221; crowd a lot of wiggle room by allowing them to point out that we have not reached many of the same signs of excess that marked the previous two bubbles. Given that the DotCom bubble and the credit bubble were two of the biggest bubbles in history, I don&#8217;t think that should give anyone much solace. It is like saying Toronto Mayor Ford doesn&#8217;t have an alcohol and drug problem because people like Keith Richards are the real addicts.

Instead of using the word bubble, let&#8217;s examine areas that point to over valuation that are diverging from fundamentals.

The first one I want to highlight is US farmland. I have been doing some work on another post that I have not yet published that deals with the agriculture sector. During this research I stumbled upon the price chart for Illinois Farm land:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/FarmNov1415.png" alt="FarmNov1415" title="FarmNov1415.png" border="0" width="600" height="397" />

The farmer&#8217;s yield on his land has increased in the past decade, but it has been marginally higher at best. It certainly has not increased anywhere near enough to justify a quadrupling of prices. Not only that, prices of the agriculture commodities have been heading straight down over the last two years.

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/CRBFoodNov1513.gif" alt="CRBFoodNov1513" title="CRBFoodNov1513.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

These two prices certainly seem to be going in opposite directions. I am sure that it has nothing to do with the $85 billion a month that the Fed is injecting into the market. Nope &#8211; Dr. Yellen sees no bubbles here.

How about Bitcoins? The electronic currency has gone from virtually worthless to almost $500 in the last year:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/BTCNov1513.png" alt="BTCNov1513" title="BTCNov1513.png" border="0" width="600" height="267" />

At this price, this &#8220;currency&#8221; which pretty well has nothing else going for it except that it is no one&#8217;s liability, has a market cap of approximately $6 billion US dollars. I don&#8217;t need to get in a fight with the bitcoiniacs, but suffice it to say that this valuation is purely a function of the Fed&#8217;s excessively easy monetary policy. If the Fed immediately pushed monetary policy to a more normal level and stopped QE, I suspect BitCoin would have trouble staying at these lofty prices and would revert to its fundamental value (I will leave that to you guys to decide what it is &#8211; my bet is that it is lower).

But you might argue, both of these examples are small markets compared to the massive global financial system.

True enough &#8211; these specific examples by themselves, do not really signify too much to be concerned about.

However, Yellen was also asked about another asset class that she was adamant was not overvalued and nothing to worry about. Yellen was asked if she thought the QE was creating a &#8220;sugar high&#8221; that artificially goosed equity prices.

Although she is not that concerned, I am rather worried that the market has gotten way ahead of itself.

Yellen specifically mentioned that stocks were not over priced relative to earnings. Let&#8217;s have a look at that.

Here are the current earnings for the S&P 500:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/SP500EarnNov1513.gif" alt="SP500EarnNov1513" title="SP500EarnNov1513.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

You can see that they have indeed bounced hard off the lows of 2009 and are up almost 3 fold since then. Yellen points to the forward P/E ratio and says that stocks are not overpriced:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/ForwardPENov1513.gif" alt="ForwardPENov1513" title="ForwardPENov1513.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

At the current forward earnings rate of approximately 14.5, that would imply that earnings are expected to grow to $124. Right now there is roughly $104 of earnings, so that would mean a 20% increase in earnings next year. Not bad considering that the economy is growing at 3%.

We are also now approaching the highs in the P/E ratio that we saw in 2007 before the bottom fell out. Don&#8217;t forget that at cyclical peak earnings, the ratio should actually decline as the market anticipates a levelling out and even dropping of earnings &#8211; not be hitting new highs!

However, the market is now assuming that the earnings are going to continue aggressively grow from here. 

Given that corporate earnings are approaching all time highs as a percentage of GDP, I don&#8217;t see how they can accelerate from here without a massive economic upswing:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/CPasPrcGDPNov1513.png" alt="CPasPrcGDPNov1513" title="CPasPrcGDPNov1513.png" border="0" width="600" height="360" />

This is especially true given that employee compensation as a percentage of GDP is heading into the opposite direction:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/EmplGDPNov1513.png" alt="EmplGDPNov1513" title="EmplGDPNov1513.png" border="0" width="600" height="360" />

I again don&#8217;t see how you can look at this trend and simply assume it will continue to expand further without serious social acrimony. 

The stock market is assuming that corporate profits will not only stay high, but continue to grow. I just don&#8217;t think that is a good bet.

How about looking at another valuation method that is preferred by someone even older than Yellen, but with a little more market wisdom under his belt. Warren Buffet has repeatedly mentioned the total stock market capitalization as a percent of GDP as one of his favourite indicators. What is this indicator telling us?

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/USEqtGDPNov1513.gif" alt="USEqtGDPNov1513" title="USEqtGDPNov1513.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

This ratio now stands at 127% and is approaching the highs made right before the 2008 credit crisis crash. Yes, during the DotCom bubble this figure was higher, but given the massive debt and low growth prospects now faced by our economy, it is definitely another sign that stocks are actually way higher than their usual valuations. During the 1950s to 1990s the ratio was in a more reasonable 60% to 100% of GDP.

From a technical perspective, I have to agree with Yellen &#8211; the stock market is probably not in a true bubble. I don&#8217;t like the word and I think using it gives the bulls too much ammunition for countering the bearish arguments.

We all know the world has changed a lot since William McChesney Martin was Federal Reserve Chairman in the 1950s and 1960s. During his tenure, network TV censored out Elvis Presley&#8217;s swinging hips all the while William said his job was to take away the punch bowl just when the party gets going. Today, we have Myley Cyrus getting twerked (I think that is what it is called) on National TV and Bernanke (and soon Yellen) not only leaving the punch bowl out during the loudest part of the party, but also ramming every designer drug into the mix that they can find.

I understand that stepping in front of this freight train is extremely dumb and foolish. The wall of money that is coming into the stock market is massive and relentless.

But I refuse to sign up for the bull camp and don&#8217;t accept that just because the QE is going to continue, you have to be long stocks. 

In the long run, valuation matters and ultimately the stock market is nothing more than the present value of the future earnings. Buying today at these artificially juiced prices means that a lot of things have to go perfectly right. 

Could everything continue to run a lot higher? Sure. Remember that in 1999 many great investors were made to look like fools for final part of the move that they chose to sit out. Julian Robertson and Jeremey Grantham were two smart investors that took an exceptional amount of heat for their refusal to join the party. I am also pretty sure that the market cap to GDP indicator kept Warren Buffett from buying too much at that time as well. 

And as for Janet Yellen saying that stocks are not overpriced, I think that might turn out to be as good a forecast as Bernanke&#8217;s the &#8220;sub prime will be contained&#8221; comment or Greenspan&#8217;s:

> &#8220;Although a &#8216;bubble&#8217; in home prices for the nation as a whole does not appear likely, there do appear to be, at a minimum, signs of froth in some local markets where home prices seem to have risen to unsustainable levels&#8230;. Although we certainly cannot rule out home price declines, especially in some local markets, these declines, were they to occur, likely would not have substantial macroeconomic implications.&#8221;

In 2008/9 the entire economy was brought to its knees due to the macroeconomic implications of the housing bubble that did not appear likely to Greenspan. 

There is no way we should expect Yellen to be any better at identifying overpriced markets. 

To be buying stocks today because she doesn&#8217;t see any overvaluations is as dumb as letting Bernanke or Greenspan talk to you into a bigger house in 2006 because there had never been a national decline in house prices.

I know right now everybody is partying and it sure looks like fun &#8211; but I am pretty sure they are all high on Molly or whatever other drug Myley Cyrus and her generation are into these days. I am too old to be taking any drugs and I am headed home to get a good night&#8217;s sleep.
