I have a few different &#8216;negative&#8217; European trades on right now.  These positions stemmed from my belief that very little is fixed in Europe and that their economy is going to underperform for some time to come.  It is made all the worse by the fact that the ECB is the tightest major Central Bank.

One of my bigger positions is my long German 2 year bond futures versus short US 2 year bonds futures.  This was a trade that was betting that things would get worse in Europe and cause this spread to go more negative (rates in US higher than rates in Europe).

I have been lucky enough to get this one right as the spread has collapsed on the Italian election uncertainty:

In the interest of being prudent, I am going to take profits on a third of my position today.

I am also short EuroStoxx 50 and CAC futures.  Again, I am covering half of those positions just because they have moved a long way and the bad news is becoming more fully &#8216;baked in&#8217;.

This covering of a portion of my anti-Europe bet does not constitute a change in my opinion.  It is merely a risk management adjustment.  In the long run, I am still extremely bearish on Europe and especially so on a &#8216;relative&#8217; basis.
