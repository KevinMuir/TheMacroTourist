Last Friday I left work early so I wasn&#8217;t on the desk when NXY and PRQ took their late afternoon swan dives. That is a shame and I am a little upset that I missed the action in both of those names as it was quite exciting.

Here is a chart of PRQ&#8217;s Friday trading:

You will notice that it was quite subdued all day until 3pm when rumours started circulating that the Prime Minister&#8217;s office would hold a press conference after the market closed to announce a decision about the long awaited governmental review of both Petronas&#8217; purchase of Progress Energy and CNOCC&#8217;s purchase of Nexen.

At first the market interpreted that this as good news and both PRQ and NXY rallied a little bit. However, the selling quickly became quite intense and both stocks plummeted.

Here is the intra day chart for NXY:

For those not familiar with the markets, the trading of these two stocks on Friday will be bewildering beyond belief. Why would both stocks sell off so hard right before the announcement? Surely the markets knew the announcement was coming, nothing had really changed once the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office announced the press conference. There was no reason to either buy or sell either stock aggressively in the last hour before the announcement.

Those who have not sat on a trading desk do not understand how inefficient the market actually can be. They do not understand that right before a big announcement, liquidity dries up as the major players who make the market somewhat efficient during regular trading, all withdraw their orders. At this point, it takes a lot less buying or selling to move the market. Not only that, the buying or selling feeds upon itself as weak players often follow the direction of the market mistakenly believing that someone knows more than them.

The zany trading on Friday afternoon immediately reminded me of a great excerpt from a book I had read long along called &#8220;Den of thieves.&#8221; This is a book about the Milken and Boesky era of Wall Street. One of the only sympathetic characters in the story was a fellow by the name of John Mulheren. If my memory serves me correctly, he was the only one of these crooks that refused to enter into a plea bargain in exchange for information about his fellow arbitrageurs and subsequently did more jail time than any of the other individuals, even though Mulheren&#8217;s transgressions were probably the least serious of all the traders who were prosecuted. I dug through my bookshelf and managed to track down the passage that might help to explain the trading in NXY and PRQ on Friday:

> Mulheren also delighted in his role as the enfant terrible of the arbitrage and trading communities. He loved to do battle with the arbs, most of whom he considered fat and lazy, and boasted that he usually &#8220;ate them for lunch.&#8221; One of his favourite pranks was to initiate heave buying or selling about a half hour before a major market announcement, such as an antitrust court ruling that might make or break a merger deal, was due. In fact, Mulheren would have no idea about the outcome, but the sudden activity coming across the tape would suggest that he had advance knowledge. Arbs would go crazy, especially Boesky. &#8220;What did you find out?&#8221; he&#8217;d ask breathlessly. &#8220;What do you know?&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Nothing,&#8221; Mulheren would calmly reply. &#8220;I just did this to f^$k people&#8217;s mind.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;You&#8217;re insane!&#8221; Boesky would scream. &#8220;You&#8217;re so juvenile.&#8221; Then he would hang up. Mulheren would roar with laughter.
> 
> On days when the market was weak, he loved to start dumping large arbitrage positions, knowing it would drive down the stock prices and torture other arbs sitting on large positions. Other arbs would flood him with calls, seeking information; generally he ignored them. Then, when he began to see some panic selling on their part, he&#8217;d step back in and rebuild his position at lower prices.

Although I am not claiming that someone purposely drove down NXY and PRQ on Friday afternoon, I am suggesting that markets are not always a reflection of reasoned investors making a long term decision about the investing merits of owning a particular security.

I will leave the explaining of how Friday&#8217;s trading in NXY and PRQ could possibly fit into any form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and instead will look to the wisdom of John Mulheren to explain the madness.
