In a foolish attempt to try to catch the falling gold, a couple of weeks ago I bought gold and sold S&P futures against it.   At the time I said that I would use a price of 1.00 on a ratio basis for the stop.  That happened yesterday and I am jettisoning the position.

In trading, sometimes it seems like you can do nothing wrong and other times it is exactly the opposite.  Right now I am not calling much right, so there is a very good chance that this will mark the low in gold.

However when things aren&#8217;t working, I find that sticking to my original plan that I made when I was thinking more clearly is right course of action.

Ultimately I think the world is becoming a scarier place where financial assets are getting more risky than &#8216;real assets&#8217;, but I seem to be missing a couple of fingers trying to argue with the market about that assessment, so I am going to stop before I lose any more.
