You might have noticed some of the bearish pundits out there citing the recent Chinese SHIBOR rate spikes as an ominous development that portends market turmoil ahead.

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/12/SHIBOR1WeekDec1913.gif" alt="SHIBOR1WeekDec1913" title="SHIBOR1WeekDec1913.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

There is no doubt that SHIBOR has been prone to bouts of sudden demands for loans that send the rate higher. However, I decided to do a little work and see if that affects the Western stock markets in any way.

What I found surprised me. If any thing the spikes in SHIBOR rates are followed with periods of risk assets rallying &#8211; not falling!

For example, over the last few years, when the SHIBOR over night rate moves by 50 basis points or more the S&P 500 has had the following performance:

**SHIBOR moves up by more than 50 basis points**

S&P 500 Index:
  
Next day: +0.284%
  
Next week: +0.491%

As opposed to the average move during this period of:

Next day: average +0.19%
  
Next week: average +0.286%

**SHIBOR moves up by more than 100 basis points**

S&P 500 Index:
  
Next day: +0.365%
  
Next week: +0.907%

As opposed to the average move during this period of:

Next day: average +0.19%
  
Next week: average +0.286%

You will notice that there is a definite out performance of the S&P 500 **following periods of SHIBOR rises.** This is counter intuitive to what the alarmist type financial doomsday websites would have you believe.

I think this is caused by the fact that when the Chinese system demands liquidity, the PBOC supplies it and it overflows into global risk assets. 

Regardless of the reason, the fact that SHIBOR is rising is no reason to be bearish on Western stock markets. In fact &#8211; just the opposite!

I am currently leaning short in regards to global equity indexes, but I am not going to use the SHIBOR rate rise as a reason to justify my position and in fact, the rise gives me pause.
