I don&#8217;t mean to pick on U2&#8217;s Bono as I am a big fan of the band&#8217;s music, but when rock stars are warning about economic matters, _**you know that risk is fully baked into the price.**_

Bono was at the World Bank yesterday and was pleading that US lawmakers avert the fiscal cliff. He warned that if they went over the cliff, it would devastate programs for the poor and result in &#8220;more than 60,000 deaths&#8221;.

I would respectfully suggest that Bono stick to being a rock star and avoid making hyperbolic statements about the economy that he really doesn&#8217;t understand.

But, regardless of Bono&#8217;s misdirection, there is no denying that when celebrities like him have taken the fiscal cliff as a new &#8220;cause&#8221; that there is very little chance that the market has not fully priced it in.

Today we have a meeting at the White House between the GOP and Dems about the fiscal cliff. There are a lot of comparisons between today&#8217;s meeting and the famous meeting about the debt ceiling that ushered in the last market swoon when the talks collapsed.

However, I am going to quote Business Insider&#8217;s columnist Joseph Weisenthal who summed up my opinion perfectly:

> &#8220;Those who know their history are doomed to think it is repeating.&#8221;

I am hopeful that the politicians realize that the public is fed up with partisanship and simply want a compromise reached. Maybe I am naive, but I think they are finally &#8220;getting it&#8221;. 

My only real concern is that I am misreading Obama. I have been disappointed with his failure to compromise and work _together_ with Republicans to solve problems. Now, maybe it is the Republicans fault, I am not sure. But regardless of whose fault it is, Obama is the leader and ultimately it is his responsibility to oversee the economy. On his watch uncertainty has only increased. This has created a self fulfilling negative credit destruction cycle that is very difficult to stop. He needs to show some leadership and _**lead**_ the country out of this morass.

I believe that Obama understands that this has been one of his failings, but I am also mindful of the possibility that I might be simply _wishing he understood this._ Bruce Krasting, who I respect tremendously, recently wrote a blog post that basically outlines why Obama has once again backed himself into a very adversarial corner. Here is the crux of his argument:

> I think the President has made a very dangerous move in the game of chess that is called the fiscal cliff. I don’t think Republicans will agree to give Obama the one thing he has insisted on without getting an agreement on all (or most) of the other issues. The “Reds” would be stupid if they did that.
> 
> I don’t know where Obama learned his negotiating skills, but he needs a tutor. I think the odds are very high that House Republican’s say “No”, and do not give Obama what he wants. If Boehner (or some other big shot Republican) says “no” at (or after) this Friday’s meeting, the odds of falling off the cliff will shoot through the roof. Markets will respond accordingly.
> 
> The market reacted appropriately to the President’s press conference yesterday. It fell like a stone after he reiterated his demand that Congress fix one thing today, and leave everything else blowing in the wind. The US stock market has lost more than $1Trillion since the election. A significant portion of that loss is attributable to the President’s insistence that his horse goes before the cart.
> 
> Maybe the election results give Obama the right to negotiate using the tactic, “My way or the highway”. But I don’t think Obama really has the stick he needs to beat Republicans into submission. At some point he will be forced to recognize that his bare knuckle fighting style is going to get his Administration bloodied, and bring his base of supporters a world of hurt.

If I hadn&#8217;t read Krasting I would probably be buying with both fists. I am leaning towards discounting him on this one point as a Republican supporter who is letting emotion get too much in the way of his thinking. However, I am not going to simply dismiss him (even if Bono is also warning about the very same thing).

My guess is that Krasting and Bono are the consensus on this issue. The market will be less surprised with a drive off the fiscal cliff than they will be with a long term resolution to the deal. 

I would think that the market assigns a probability something like this:

  * no deal 50%
  * kicking the can down the road, not really fixing anything in the long run deal 45%
  * long term deal 5%

I would assign probabilities more like this:

  * no deal 10%
  * kicking the can down the road, not really fixing anything in the long run deal 70%
  * long term deal 20%

I wonder what Bono thinks?
