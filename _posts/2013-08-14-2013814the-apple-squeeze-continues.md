Although the market is sagging a little this morning, the Apple squeeze is continuing in full force.

I am getting extremely worried about the frothiness of this market.  I have to give Icahn credit &#8211; he sure knows how to squeeze a stock.  But let&#8217;s stop and think about how much Apple&#8217;s business has changed in the past 48 hours that would justify this $40 billion pop in market cap.  The answer is that it hasn&#8217;t changed one iota.  Tim Cook is going to be nice and say he will listen to Carl when he phones, but it is naive to think that Cook is going to change his plans at all due to Icahn&#8217;s investment.  Apple is a massive company and Icahn owns less than 1%.  There are 10 institutions that own more than Icahn that will have considerably more influence over Cook.

I don&#8217;t know where this AAPL is going to stop, but this morning when the stock price crossed $500 I received a MarketWatch special email alert and the CNN front page looked like this:

This is the stuff of tops.

I am going to risk a few fingers and take a stab on the short side.
