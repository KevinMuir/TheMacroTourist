This morning the market is all in a tizzy because the Chicago Purchasing Manager Index blew away expectations &#8211; coming in a 65.9 versus an consensus forecast of 55.0. The US bond and stock market have gone straight down as market participants suddenly price in an increasing chance of a December taper. 

The latest good news in America comes at a time when Europe is once again showing signs of increased economic strain. The latest employment statistics were released and any notion that Europe&#8217;s economy is bouncing in any meaningful way is naive. Tyler Durden from ZeroHedge sums it up nicely:

> Those following the Euro FX pairs saw a plunge at 6 am Eastern, when Eurostat released the latest Eurozone unemployment and inflation statistics. They were, in a word, abysmal. After the August unemployment data finally saw a modest drop forcing many to announce the end of the European depression, not only did the the September number revise the August print from 12.0% to 12.2%, a new record high as 73,000 thousand people became unemployed, but more importantly made the September unemployment rate 12.2% as well following another 60,000 Eurozoneans losing their jobs, effectively meaning that for all the talk of a European recovery, its unemployment rate keeps hitting new all time record highs every single month.

EUR initially sold off on the bad European news and it has also sold off further with the good US economic news.

However, I view this sell off as a good point to initiate a small long position in EUR.

It seems counterintuitive, but this morning&#8217;s news is actually long term Euro positive. 

Europe&#8217;s economy is not expanding, and credit is not being created fast enough. The supply of Euros is in effect shrinking in relation to other global currencies as the ECB is not applying enough monetary expansion. 

Contrast that to the US where the economy is starting to show real signs of life (even though the US lawmakers are doing their best to kill any small economic revival). 

Now remember I am not saying that the US economy is going to grow quickly, I am merely saying on a relative basis the US economy is much better situated than the European economies.

And this is because of the following chart:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/ECBFedOct3113.gif" alt="ECBFedOct3113" title="ECBFedOct3113.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

You can see that the Fed&#8217;s total balance sheet (yellow line) is expanding rapidly, while the ECB&#8217;s total balance sheet (white line) continues to drift lower as the ECB winds down previous emergency measures.

Unless you think that the recent US economic strength is going to cause a serious reduction in the expansion of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet (and don&#8217;t forget taper is only a reduction in the rate of expansion, not an outright stop of expansion) or you think that the Europeans are going to reinstate their emergency measures, this trend of a larger Federal Reserve balance sheet and a smaller ECB balance sheet is only going to continue.

This trend will cause more US dollars to be created than Euros and will push the value of the Euro higher. 

And lest you think I am being overly pessimistic about the European&#8217;s willingness to expand their balance sheet, here are the latest comments coming out of the ECB:

> \* \*ECB&#8217;S NOWOTNY SAYS &#8216;NO REALISTIC PROSPECT&#8217; OF RATE CUT: MNI
> 
> \* \*NOWOTNY SAYS ECB UNLIKELY TO CUT BENCHMARK OR DEPOSIT RATE: MNI
> 
> \* \*NOWOTNY SAYS POLICY MAKERS &#8216;HAVE TO LIVE WITH&#8217; STRONG EURO: MNI

I am taking advantage of this morning&#8217;s short term flows lower and buying 1.3625 EUR. I will risk all the way down to the lower end of the range at 1.34 on a NY closing basis.
