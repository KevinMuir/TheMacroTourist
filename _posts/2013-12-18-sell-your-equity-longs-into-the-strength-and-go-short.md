I had [recently suggested](http://gfbblogs.azurewebsites.net/blog/2013/12/16/time-to-bring-the-shorts-in-blue-tickets-only-for-the-next-little-while/) being long equities into the Fed announcement as I thought that if they did taper, the market had fully baked it in. 

Proving that even I get the occasional call right, that is exactly what happened.

The S&P has spiked up 30 handles on the news:

Although I had planned on staying long throughout the Christmas holiday season, my spidey sense is tingling and I am worried about the market action.

This afternoon felt like a short squeeze as opposed to a good solid advance. I believe that many traders were &#8220;worried about the taper&#8221;, and this is the exact &#8220;sell the rumour, buy the news&#8221; reaction I was anticipating.

However, the underlying stock market does not feel that strong. Many stocks are trading poorly, and today&#8217;s action in the US dollar (first down and then up) is somewhat worrisome:

I am going to push my luck after the recent good call and say that you should completely sell your long, and go short&#8230;

For some reason, I just don&#8217;t trust this rally and I have learned that following these sorts of hunches is often the right course of action. If we get a face ripping upward move into year end, you will be right to scold me for getting too cute and not following my original plan. However, I am willing to take that chance&#8230;
