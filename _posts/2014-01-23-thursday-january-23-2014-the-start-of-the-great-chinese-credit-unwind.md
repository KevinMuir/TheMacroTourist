Last night China released their PMI statistics for the last month of 2013. MarketWatch did a good job of summing up the terrible results:

> China&#8217;s manufacturing sector is showing an unexpected contraction in January, albeit a mild one, according to initial results from HSBC&#8217;s monthly survey released Thursday. The &#8220;flash&#8221; version of the HSBC/Markit China manufacturing Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index fell to a six-month low of 49.6, down from a final December reading of 50.5, with the result sending Chinese stocks and the Australian dollar all lower. Economists had expected the flash PMI &#8212; which usually includes 85%-90% of total responses used for the final report &#8212; to print at 50.3, according to a Bloomberg News forecast. Results below the 50 level indicate contraction, while those above 50 suggest growth. Among the subindexes, overall new orders swung to a decline, while new export orders &#8212; already in contractionary territory &#8212; showed a faster rate of losses. The closely watched employment subindex also fell at a faster rate than in December. HSBC chief China economist Hongbin Qu said the &#8220;marginal contraction &#8230; was mainly dragged by cooling domestic demand conditions.&#8221;

There can be no doubt that the Chinese economy is limping along with very few positive signs on the horizon.

It was only a few short years ago that the investing public was absolutely _convinced_ that China would grow at 10% forever, and anyone who suggested otherwise was a fool who just didn&#8217;t &#8220;get it.&#8221; At the time famed short seller Jim Chanos was extremely bearish on China and he was derided and ridiculed for not understanding the Chinese growth miracle and some even claimed the fact that he had never been to China was the reason for his lack of understanding. To this Chanos responded with one of the all time classic retorts (and I am paraphrasing here) &#8211; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t work at Enron, but that didn&#8217;t mean I couldn&#8217;t see that it was a great short.&#8221; Chanos was adamant that math was math, and that Chinese math did not add up. He had all sorts of statistics about the staggering amount of extra infrastructure and high rise office space that was being built. At the end of the day his basic premise was that China was hitting their 10% growth target because they were willing to spend that much, which was easy in their command economy. But just because you were spending that much did not mean that the investments were economical. The GDP growth was the result of over investment that never had any chance of being able to generate the hoped for expected return. The China bulls claimed that this time it was different, but of course, it never is&#8230;

Fast forward to today. Now China has this massively imbalanced economy, with too much reliance on infrastructure spending and exports, and to top it all off, a hugely leveraged financial system that relies on ever increasing spending to service the massive debts.

Have a look at the amount of corporate debt of various countries:

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

China leads the world with its massive corporate indebtedness.

It made perfect sense for the Chinese corporations to lever up &#8211; previously the government had committed to growing at 10%, and regardless of the intelligence of that investment, the target was going to be hit. That meant that corporations could count on the spending come hell or high water.

Now the government has changed their plan, with the realization that maybe all that spending was not such a good idea.

And as Warren Buffett likes to say &#8211; now that the tide is going out, we are going to see who is swimming without a suit on.

Everyone now knows that China is having trouble. Even the most ardent China bulls who two years ago were on CNBC telling Chanos he didn&#8217;t understand China now admit that China has over spent and needs to rebalance.

**The real question to now ask is not did China get themselves into trouble, but how bad is it going to be?
  
** 

This question is not that easily answered, and anyone who claims they know the answer probably was previously also telling you that China would grow at 10% forever.

I distinctly remember the start of the US credit crisis in 2007. Although there was the occasional alarmist, most everyone thought that the damage would be contained to a few sectors and that the over indebtedness was not going to be unmanageable. **The initial contracting of credit was a slow motion event, with tiny little signs that the snow was piling up on the slope, until finally it all unleashed in a massive avalanche of selling.** But there were signs &#8211; no one can claim that the market did not give you warnings.

These same sorts of warnings are now occurring for China.

I am not claiming that Chinese is about to experience a 2007 style credit crisis &#8211; I think that anyone who asserts this with any certainty is an over confident fool. However, I am claiming that this is a _definite possibility_ and the situation needs to be watched extremely closely.

This could be the very sort of out of nowhere event that the global financial market is not prepared for. **Remember, financial crashes never occur due to events that the market has anticipated. They are always surprises.**

China&#8217;s credit system is a complicated web of different interconnected parts. There is a large &#8220;shadow&#8221; component that makes understanding what is really happening in their economy very difficult to ascertain. Here is a graphic from ZH that outlines the way debt gets repackaged:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter" style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="chinawealthJan2314.gif" alt="ChinawealthJan2314" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/chinawealthJan2314.gif" width="600" height="364" border="0" />
</p>

I cannot claim any ability to handicap whether this &#8220;shadow&#8221; lending is a threat to the Chinese economy, or simply something that makes good headlines for the China bears. However, my gut tells me that the China bulls were surprised at how the China miracle was not nearly as wonderful as they had predicted, and that this decade long bull market had been more on the back of imprudent lending than anyone would ever have believed.

**I am not taking a position, but if forced to, I would argue that the credit unwind is going to get much uglier before it gets better.**

Just like the Japanese &#8220;economic miracle&#8221; of the 1980s proved to be on the back of massive corporate indebtedness, I think the Chinese &#8220;miracle&#8221; of the 2000s will prove just as illusory.

The bills are coming due and they are shockingly large.

Recently Bank of America wrote a research report about the potential of massive defaults from the shadow lending. The report called &#8220;The 3bn CNY Beast Knocking&#8221; explains how many of these shadow lending vehicles are coming due in the coming quarters and proceeds to handicap the odds that they default:

> CNY stands for the currency, and also a beast
> 
> CNY represents China’s official currency. It also stands for Chinese New Year, the biggest holiday for the country and the occasion for family reunions and celebration. But less familiar for many, however, the Year (?) itself actually stood for a beast which comes out every 365 days and eats everything along the way from bugs to humans. The holiday tradition started as a way for people to fend off the beast by getting together and lighting up the firecrackers.
> 
> At the same time, custom dictated that people also to paid their due to avoid becoming the beast’s target. In particular, it has been a tradition to settle all debt before the New Year. From the perspective of such folk culture, the trust product Credit Equals Gold #1, referred as CEQ1 hereafter, by China Credit Trust planned poorly for having the maturing date on the New Year, leaving a 3bn CNY beast running wild.
> 
> High probability for the trust product to default
> 
> In a sense, the product is in technical default already. The last coupon payment in December, with nearly all the money (CNY80mn) left in the trust account, came in at only 2.7%, falling far short of the promised yield. The bigger trouble is the CNY3bn principal payment, along with the delinquent coupon, on 31 January.
> 
> We see high probability of default on 31 January
> 
> Political or economic consideration: ultimately, given the government’s strong grip on financial institutions, default may be a political decision as much as an economic decision. From that perspective, CEQ1 would be a good candidate for default. The minimum investment in CEQ1 is CNY3mn, much more than the typical amount required for other trust investment and 75 times of per capita GDP in China. If defaults were to be used to send a warning signal to shadow banking investors, this group of rich investors may have been a good target because the government does not need to worry too much of them demonstrating in front of government offices.
> 
> Timing: there is never a good timing for deleverage because of risks involved. But the current job market situation provides a solid buffer should defaults and subsequent credit contraction slow down the economy growth. The government planned 9mn jobs last year; instead it has created more than 12mn by November. So the system could withstand a potential shock.
> 
> Financial capability: China Credit Trust has a bit over CNY10bn net assets, which some analysts cite as evidence of the trust company’s capability to fully redeem the product first and recover from the collateral asset later. However, the assets might not be liquid enough, so the net asset is not the best measure. Based on its 2012 annual report, the company has liquid asset of CNY3bn and short-term liability of CNY1.35bn, leaving liquid accessible fund of CNY1.65bn at most. ICBC for certain has much deeper pocket, but it has declared that it won’t be taking major responsibility.

The complexity and opaqueness of this whole shadow lending has too many eerie similarities to the American credit crisis of 2007:

> The potential first default, even if it’s not CEQ1 on 31 JANUARY, would be important based on the experience of what happened to the US and Europe; the market has tended to underestimate the initial event. Over the last year, China appeared to be mirroring what happened in the US during 2007, the spike of money rate (much higher repo/SHIBOR), the steepening of money curve (14d money much more expensive than overnight and 7d), and small accidents here and there (junior tranches of a few wealth management products offered by Haitong Securities losing more than 60%, a few small trusts and now CEQ1’s redemption difficulty).

This brings me to what I think is the most important take away from this whole post &#8211; &#8220;the market has tended to underestimate the initial event.&#8221;

The market is not nearly as efficient as Burton Malkiel believes and if this default occurs, the full extent of the chance of the contagion spreading will take a period of weeks or even months to fully price in. The 2007 credit crisis started slowly and like a snowball rolling down a hill, started small but kept on gaining mass until it was almost unstoppable.

If we are to get a China credit crisis, there will be plenty of time to act.

**But most importantly, do not believe anyone who claims that it will be _contained._** Markets always go much further on both sides of the spectrum of fair value. The pricing of China&#8217;s miracle got stupidly optimistic in the mid to late 2000s, it will get equally stupidly pessimistic during the unwind.

Do not buy dips in the China unwind. Wait until it is stupid cheap and they are giving it away. In the mean time, batten down the hatches and be careful about the potential that it spreads to the rest of the financial system.

**Positions**

**UPDATE Short Canadian dollar.** I have been short and quite patient with the trade that is going my way.  However, yesterday after the Bank of Canada meeting, the CAD sold off hard.  **Towards the end of the day I covered a quarter of the position.**  Maybe it is a mistake, but when the ducks are quacking &#8211; feed &#8217;em.    Conviction level: 3. Also **Short CAD against JPY and EUR.**  Small position size.

****Long Yen.****  This is a counter trend trade where I am just begging the Market Gods to punish me.  However, I do believe that the Yen is oversold and due for a move higher.  The Americans shot across the bow might very well be the catalyst. **** **Conviction: 2.  **Stops are last weeks low in Yen terms.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Short S&P 500.    **I still believe the risk reward favours the short side.  **We are so close to new highs that you need to steel yourself for the potential breakout, but I am not going to cover into any squeeze and will sit tight into new highs.  I suspect if we do have a break out, it will be a last gasp.  Be ready for a &#8220;pop and drop&#8221;.  **Conviction: 4

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

**Long various natural gas contracts.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather. Conviction level: 3 No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
