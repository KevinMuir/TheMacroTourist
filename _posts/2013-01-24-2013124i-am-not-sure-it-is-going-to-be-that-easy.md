Last night Japan&#8217;s deputy economy minister signalled that a Yen at 100 to the dollar wouldn&#8217;t be a problem.  Since then, market participants have pushed the Yen back to the 90 level after some recent strength over the previous couple of days:

Although I agree that 100 USDJPY is a very reasonable target for the Japanese government to shoot for, I am concerned that the next 10 handles are not going to be as easily accomplished as the previous 10.

The move from 78 to 90 was relatively easy.  The BOJ did not have to intervene at all &#8211; the simple steadfastness of the newly elected Prime Minister was enough to convince market players that this time they meant business.

However, the rest of the world is now voicing displeasure of the Japanese government&#8217;s devaluation policy.  This morning Angela Merkel joined the list of other country&#8217;s leaders who are not at all happy with the Japanese.  The other day it was Korea &#8211; the list is quickly growing.

Market players are going to start questioning whether Prime Minister Abe has the stomach to weather the global political storm that his policies will unleash.

I believe that Abe will indeed follow through with his devaluation policies, but I suspect it will take_ **more than words to move it to the next level.  **_

Therefore I am taking this opportunity to reduce my very large Yen short to the smallest it has been in some time.  I am still short as I believe the really big surprises are always in the direction of the trend, but I want to get a little closer to the sidelines.

I am not necessarily looking for a correction in terms of price.  There is a decent chance that the Yen will chop around this level for some time to come.  I just think that the breakout will not happen until words are followed by actions.

Goldman Sachs made this great timetable that outlines the important dates for the Japanese government:

You can see that there are some important changes to the BOJ committee that are scheduled to occur in the next couple of months.  My suspicion is that until we get the change in personnel, the Yen will have difficulty weakening dramatically from the 90 level.
