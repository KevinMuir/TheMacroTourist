This morning&#8217;s Twitter IPO debut pop of 73% and Mario Draghi&#8217;s surprise ECB cut has not been enough to hold the stock market higher.

Ever since this morning&#8217;s &#8220;get me in&#8221; Draghi squeeze, world stock markets have been steadily drifting lower.

European stocks:

US stocks:

Although the US indexes are holding near their all time highs:

The bloom has definitely come off he high flying MOMO stocks. My homemade Four Horsemen index is hitting new lows for this move:

And even Jim Cramer&#8217;s &#8220;these stocks can&#8217;t go down&#8221; Cult stocks are once again stumbling:

Although the market indexes are hanging in there, more and more stocks are breaking support and heading lower.

From a sentiment point of view, there is definitely a feeling of &#8220;QE has got your back &#8211; there is no other game in town &#8211; you have to be long stocks.&#8221; On Twitter, I have actually seen many market watchers making fun of anyone who is short. 

Some of the actual sentiment indexes (as opposed to my anecdotal evidence) are also confirming that we are reaching extremes in bullishness. I don&#8217;t want to publish any of his work, but the Sentiment Trader has some great graphs and studies that show we are increasingly hitting danger territory.

I know that frothy conditions can continue way longer than most can imagine. 

I am also of the opinion that the market is overly concerned about the Fed tapering any time soon, which according to common wisdom should mean stocks would be able to rise for even longer.

However, I believe the market is becoming increasingly overconfident. As Mark Twain said, &#8220;It ain&#8217;t what you don&#8217;t know that gets you into trouble. It&#8217;s what you know for sure that just ain&#8217;t so.&#8221;

Right now, everyone &#8220;knows&#8221; that the Fed is going to be printing forever and that _means stocks are headed higher._ However, there is nothing saying that this relationship cannot change. To argue that stocks have to go up no matter what is just foolishness. Surely there has to be a price that would make stocks a poor bet. If the S&P was suddenly 3500 tomorrow, then no one would argue that the Fed&#8217;s printing would matter. So at extremes it is obvious, so why can&#8217;t at the margin the same thing happen? At a certain point in price and time, the current Fed printing is going to have no effect on the market. It will be &#8220;all baked in&#8221;.

I am willing to take a chance to say that we have reached this point (at least for the short term). I am shorting US stocks throughout the day today. I am willing to bet that a correction might be closer upon us than most realize.
