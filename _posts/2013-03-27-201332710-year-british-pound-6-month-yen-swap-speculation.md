In 1994 the Orange County treasurer bankrupted the county through a $14 billion dollar derivatives bet gone wrong. &nbsp;Of course it made perfect sense for Orange Country to be speculating in fixed income derivatives. &nbsp;And of course Merrill Lynch was more than happy to oblige with some nice exotic derivatives. &nbsp;

As I paged through my Bloomberg news today I found the following article that reminded me of Orange Country:

> France’s Towns Demand Rescue From ‘Time Bomb’ of Dexia Loans

> &nbsp;March 27 (Bloomberg) &#8212; French towns from Asnieres to Sainte-Etienne are calling on President Francois Hollande’s government to save them from about 10 billion euros ($13 billion) in Dexia loans whose risks they say weren’t made clear. &nbsp;

> Sitting on debt pegged to foreign interest rates or currencies, many troubled municipalities are struggling to service their loans and clamoring for help from the state.

> &nbsp; “This is a time bomb for a certain number of local governments,” Sebastien Pietrasanta, the mayor of Asnieres, a Paris suburb, told reporters yesterday. “We need a global solution and not just a case-by-case” treatment from the state, &nbsp;he said. Asnieres sued Dexia’s French unit last year over a loan tied to the dollar-yen exchange rate.

> 
> Saint-Etienne has three loans amounting to a total of 61.5 million euros from Dexia’s defunct French unit that are now on SFIL’s books.

> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loans include one linked to the difference between the 10-year British pound constant-maturity-swap and the 6-month Japanese benchmark, Jean-Gabriel Madinier, the city’s secretary general, said by phone.

        Let&#8217;s see&#8230; &nbsp;French municipalities speculating in 10 year British pound 6 month Yen swaps? &nbsp;Not only does this trade involve a bet on the respective yield curves, but it also involves two currencies that have nothing to do with the finances of a French municipal government. &nbsp;This is completely absurd. &nbsp;I am not sure who is more guilty &#8211; the stupid municipal treasurer or the Investment bank who sold it to him. &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If this is any sign of the state of the Europe&#8217;s balance sheet then I am not nearly bearish enough. &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The investment banks have completely taken advantage of these unsuspecting government officials who are desperate to make money to pay for the unrealistic promises they have made to their citizens. &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It is quite scary. &nbsp;Remember desperate people do desperate things, and these guys are becoming increasingly desperate.

        In the mean time I will leave you with a joke about investment bankers that I have taken the liberty of editing a little&#8230;
