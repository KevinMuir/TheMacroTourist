Have a look at this chart:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/SPCACVEN%20Apr%2002%2013.gif" />

The white line is the S&P 500 and the scale is the percentage return over the last year.  The S&P 500 is up roughly 10% during this period, but what are the other two lines?

First hint, the yellow lined security is down 30% and the orange lined security is up 9.5%.

Second hint, they are all stock indexes.

Third hint, of the two mystery indexes, one is from North America and the other one from Europe.

Give up?  How about if I told you one was the French CAC40 index and the other was the TSX Venture Index?  Would you now know which one was which?

My suspicion is that anybody involved in the Canadian resource sector probably guessed the chart right away, but that most others would be surprised to find that the white line is the CAC 40 index and the yellow line is the S&P TSX Venture index.

Here is the chart for the S&P TSX Venture index on its own:

It is one of the ugliest looking indexes out there.  Even with US stock markets hitting all time highs on a daily basis, this index is hitting new lows and showing absolutely zero signs of life.  It is one thing to be not participating in the global stock index rally, but it is quite another to be down 30% and pushing to new lows at the same time.

This massive crash in small cap Canadian resource stocks is one of the sleeper stories of the last few months.  It is getting very little attention, but it is devastating the Canadian brokerage and resource community.

I read recently that Sprott&#8217;s Rick Rule said something to the effect that there were 1,000 Canadian venture companies with less than $200k in the bank.  I have probably got that quote wrong, but the important part to realize is that many exploration companies have been unable to get funding.  Period.  Full stop.  They are desperate, yet they can&#8217;t raise capital &#8211; at any price.

How did we ever get in a situation like this?

Well, this was the direct result of the massive speculation that went on in the 2000s regarding the belief that China would grow at 10% forever.  The disciples of the Church of Perpetual Chinese Growth speculated in resources &#8211; betting that China would be forever demanding more and more supply.  These disciples became rich beyond belief as China&#8217;s demand did in fact seem infinite.  The disciples that bought the riskiest, most speculative resource stocks were rewarded the most, quickly becoming multi millionaires as these stocks went up the fastest.  There was a test of faith in 2008 with the credit crisis, but the massive Chinese demand stimulus only rewarded those Church Members who stayed true to the faith as these stocks were the quickest to rebound.

However, the Church of Perpetual Chinese growth has proven to not be quite as holy as many disciples believed as the Chinese slow down of the last few years has not resulted in any where near the demand for resources as they had originally postulated.  Not only that, but surprise surprise, higher prices did what higher price should do &#8211; bring on supply.  The massive speculation in the early 2000s allowed many mines to be financed.

The idea that China had somehow repealed the business cycle has made the ultimate boom and now bust all the larger.

Which brings me back to Canada&#8217;s small cap resource market.  There are simply too many speculative resource stocks out there that don&#8217;t stand a hope in hell in succeeding.  The speculative boom of the 2000s created an environment where any one with a bit of swamp land and the ability to spell some of these rare earths without having to look it up in the dictionary with way too much money.  Rare earths, copper, iron ore, they were all the same.  They all relied on China growing at 10% forever.

Now that we realize that this is obviously not going to happen, we are experiencing the dark side of the religion of Chinese Perpetual Growth.

I don&#8217;t have any trabeable ideas for this post.  I am trying my best to avoid getting sucked into bottom fishing in this square.  I do believe that someone with the analytical skill to differentiate the various small cap stocks very well might be able to make a fortune in this environment, but I don&#8217;t have that skill set.

I know that they are absolutely punishing small cap resource stocks that are trying to finance the next stage of their projects.  Have a look at these two small cap junior resource plays that tried to float some securities:

It is quite something that we are experiencing all this pain all the while the American stock market is zinging to new highs every day.  Maybe we weren&#8217;t quite as smart as we thought, eh?
