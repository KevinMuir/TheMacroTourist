I have not written about Italian bonds in a while and I kind miss the zaniness of trading these things. Since Mario Draghi calmed the European debt markets with his &#8220;whatever it takes&#8221; speech and spreads tightened to more &#8220;normal&#8221; levels, I have been hesitant to get involved. Although I firmly believe the fundamentals are squarely against most of Europe, I recognized that liquidity can hide a lot of problems for a long time. This was a good call as spreads (and overall funding levels) for the PIIGS have been steadily decreasing:

I have kept the European markets on my radar as one of the analysts that I respect a great deal, Grant Williams, had this theory that the European markets would remain calm until the German elections were completed in mid September and after that, all the problems would once again bubble to the surface. It was his theory that officials would do everything in their power to avoid any political kerfuffles until Merkel was re-elected. At that point, Europe could return to its dysfunctional ways.

I am short French OATs against long German Bunds, but that trade has been a bore. Although it hasn&#8217;t cost me anything, so far it is only slightly more interesting than the much too large CFA Level 2 accounting section (only CA&#8217;s can get excited about the difference in the writing down of goodwill between various countries for multinational companies).

A couple of weeks ago, I started establishing a short Italian BTPs vs long German Bunds as a &#8220;just in case things got squirrelly&#8221; trade. This morning I am adding to it.

Over the week-end, as Grant Williams predicted, politics did again rise to the front page in Europe as Belursconi has attempted to send the Italian voters back to the election booth through the mass resigning of ministers from his party. From Reuters:

> Berlusconi said he decided on the shock move on Saturday after the government&#8217;s failure to avert a long-programmed hike in sales tax at a cabinet meeting the day before. Letta dismissed the motivation as a &#8220;huge lie,&#8221; saying instead that the media tycoon, who celebrated his 77th birthday on Sunday, was acting out of fury at his impending expulsion from parliament following a conviction for tax fraud. With fears that markets will punish Italy for the political turmoil, all eyes now are on whether Napolitano can muster backing either for a second Letta government or for an administration led by another figure.
> 
> If not, Italy would be forced to return to the polls with a major risk that, with a dysfunctional electoral law and three parties of roughly equal size, they would produce a hung parliament and yet more instability. Berlusconi on Sunday called for new elections, but there were signs that some allies may not be willing to follow him.
> 
> &#8220;The only path to follow is to go with determination towards new elections,&#8221; Berlusconi told a party gathering in Naples in a telephone link-up. &#8220;I am convinced that a government of taxes is not in the interests of our country.&#8221;
> 
> Economy Minister Fabrizio Saccomanni played down the risk that Italy&#8217;s borrowing costs would shoot up when markets open on Monday, a danger highlighted by other cabinet members. &#8220;I think the uncertainty connected to the government&#8217;s instability has been largely already factored in during the last few weeks,&#8221; he told business daily Il Sole 24 Ore.

I am not knowledgeable enough to understand the intricacies of Italian politics, but I am willing to bet that Grant Williams is correct when he predicted that the problems were being suppressed long enough to get through the German elections.

And a little later in the week-end, Zero Hedge announced this strange development:

> The situation in Italy appears to be going from bad to worse. With a confidence vote pending for Tuesday as the government dissolves into chaos for the umpteenth time, and following the resignation of the CEO of one of Italy&#8217;s largest non-financial corporations (Telecom Italia), the largest bank (by assets) in Italy &#8211; Intesa SanPaolo has announced &#8211; effective immediately &#8211; the resignation of its CEO and replacement with Carlo Messina. According to sources, the now former CEO had lost the confidence of shareholders (which is odd given the bank&#8217;s stock is near 2-year highs).

I am willing to bet that where there is smoke, there is fire.

The German Italian 10 year bond spread is still relatively low:

<img class="aligncenter" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="ITGR10sSep3013.gif" alt="ITGR10sSep3013" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/09/ITGR10sSep3013.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" />

Although it has rallied a little on these latest developments, it is still very contained. I believe that going long this spread is a good risk reward. I will risk down to new lows on the long position. I expect that Italy&#8217;s funding situation is going to get worse before it gets better.
