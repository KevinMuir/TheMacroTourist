    Last night all star harness racing jockey turned hedge fund manager Doug Kass was on CNBC talking about why the worries about the fiscal cliff were overblown. Doug went through a very convincing argument about why the increase to the capital gains tax from 15% to 25% was inconsequential to the long term pricing of the stock market. I won&#8217;t rehash his argument, but the crux of it was that a majority of the stock market capitalization is held in non-taxable accounts and that for the other percentage that is taxable, the actual amount of capital gains is quite small (due to low turnover and other factors). It was a tempting argument.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, I really think that Doug was simplifying the argument to a level that did not incorporate the nuances of the current economic climate.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am also being bombarded with other arguments that it will be ok if we head over the cliff because the taxes can all be adjusted retroactively in February or March. Therefore the reasoning goes, there is no real deadline, we just need to have it done sometime early next year.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All of these &#8220;the cliff is not so bad&#8221; arguments are forgetting one important detail. The global economy is experiencing a <strong><em>massive debt del-levering.</em></strong> Private sector credit is being destroyed faster than the governments can spend/print it. The velocity of money continues to plunge at an astounding rate.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <img class="aligncenter" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Velocity of M2 Dec 04 12.png" alt="NewImage" src="/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/50c60ed7e4b026203261c700/1354650823057/Velocity%20of%20M2%20Dec%2004%2012.png/1000w" width="600" height="360" border="0" />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The reasons for this de-leveraging are many and complicated. To some extent this is the natural consequence of the credit super cycle. It is also deeply affected by demographics &#8211; something that is not really controllable (especially in the short to medium run).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, the velocity of money is greatly affected by <strong><em>societal attitudes towards the economy.</em></strong> If there is uncertainty about the future, then the businessman puts off investing in new capital equipment. This causes a self reinforcing cycle as the lack of spending creates more uncertainty, which then causes even less spending.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It is the government&#8217;s job to institute <em>counter cyclical policies</em> and cushion the ups and downs in the cycle.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Therefore during this period of private sector credit destruction, the very last thing you need is for the government to introduce more uncertainty. The current natural state of the economy is for the de-leveraging to continue. Absent appropriate monetary and fiscal stimulus, the private sector credit destruction will simply overwhelm the economy, sending it back into a self reinforcing deflationary spiral.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Which brings me back to the fiscal cliff. Having politicians bickering in public about the fiscal cliff does not inspire confidence. Having the debt ceiling limit bumped up against again does not encourage the businessman to spend money on capital equipment. No, going over the fiscal cliff simply exacerbates the relentless decline in the velocity of money.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So Kass and the other pundits who are claiming that a trip over the cliff won&#8217;t be so bad are missing the long term consequences. Yes, they are correct that the economy is not going to plunge into an abyss, but the current economic malaise that is looking increasingly like the Japanese lost decade will be further cemented as our economic fate.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    These same pundits are forgetting that the fiscal cliff will introduce the largest tax hike as a percentage of GDP <em>ever imposed on the US economy.</em> This is not the sort of pro-cyclical fiscal drag that a struggling over indebted economy needs. In fact, it will most likely cause a pretty nasty recession.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I realize a lot of you are either saying, &#8220;good &#8211; those Republican buggers are going to get all the blame&#8221; or &#8220;good &#8211; we finally need to impose some discipline in Washington.&#8221; I am judging neither side. I am merely observing that going over the cliff is a way bigger deal than most realize.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The consequences will not be immediate, but they will be long lasting and severe.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Economists love to look back at the policy errors of the 1930s that made the Great Depression &#8220;Great&#8221;. I think they very well could look back at the massive policy errors of this de-leveraging and point to the Fiscal Cliff debacle as just as damaging.
