I am a big bear on the Japanese Yen. Over the last year I have had the position on in various sizes, but for the last month I have steered clear of it.

That has been fortunate as the Yen has slowly been creeping higher.

This morning it has pushed to new highs for this latest move and I am going to use this strength to start a short position.

So I am putting on 25% of my position in here with the Yen in the low 97s. 

More to follow…

(don&#8217;t forget that USDJPY is inverse… so the latest dip in the rate actually signifies Yen strength… I am buying this rate)
