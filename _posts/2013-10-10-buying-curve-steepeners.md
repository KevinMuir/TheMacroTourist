I am going to follow this up with a more detailed post, but this morning I wanted to highlight that I am initiating a long position on US treasury curve steepeners.

Specifically I am buying the 2-30 year spread:

And also the 5-30 year spread:

I will expand further on the reasoning for these positions in a coming post, but to quickly summarize, I believe that Bill Fleckenstein&#8217;s theory that &#8220;the printing will continue until the bond market takes away the press&#8221; is the correct way to trade the current environment. If you believe Bill&#8217;s theory, it makes sense that the Fed will lose control of the long end of the curve, while they desperately try to anchor the shorter end. 

I believe that there is a decent chance that before this whole QE gone mad science experiment is over that the curve will become record steep. I am starting to position accordingly.
