The other day when I was driving my daughter to gymnastics at the University of Toronto, I was cruising through a neighbourhood known as the Annex.  This is a terrific little community, with a mix of urban professionals in renovated Victorian homes alongside student housing.  Although there are some very nice sections, it is not the place that the &#8216;must be seen&#8217; fast money crowd chooses to live.  Therefore I was hugely surprised when I happened to see a brand new Lamborghini with the licence plate BBRY10.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/517ac570e4b0cbefe20c7c41/1367000434158/velano_aventador_1501_09.jpg" />

First of all, it was hugely out of place.  This is a neighbourhood where you are more likely to find a Prius or maybe at the fanciest, a Tesla electric car.  My suspicion is that a lot Annex residents probably felt like Satan has just parked his car in the driveway.  This thing was massive and the all black colour made it look even more menacing.

However, what attracted me the most was the licence plate.  BBRY10.  Now, BBRY is the new symbol for Research in Motion.  This is a new symbol as of a few months ago, so there is no way this was an old licence plate.  And the 10 referred to the new Blackberry operating system which only confirmed that it was a new plate.  My suspicion that this $300k+ car was paid for by a great pass in the Blackberry stock.  My hats off to the guy (although I would have chosen something a little more elegant like an Aston Martin).

Which brings me to the real point of this post.  I am bullish on BBRY.  I have taken a small position, but when I see guys driving around in super cars paid for by a stock&#8217;s great performance, I worry I am late to the party.

As I have mentioned in previous posts, I am a huge Prem Watsa from Fairfax Financial fan.  Many people compare him to Warren Buffet, but I think he is better as his outstanding returns have been made even though he is perpetually worried about the market falling apart.  He is no levered up long player, he is a true terrific value investor.  Prem has a monster stake in BBRY, almost 10% of the company.  He has showed no signs of selling and insists he is in it for the long haul.

Now just because Prem owns it, is not reason enough to go buy it.  Prem is still human and you should always do your own work.  But it sure is helpful to know that he is on your side of the trade.

During the last year, I have to confess as to have been a little skeptical of the BBRY story.  I was not sure that they would be able to ever recoup from their terrible stumbles that the original founders made while at the wheel.  It didn&#8217;t help when I heard stories from friends who dealt with senior founders at RIMM and relayed what complete jackasses they (maybe just he) were&#8230;  I mean come &#8216;on, how do you go about pissing off even the NHL so much they don&#8217;t want to sell you a team?  So although as a Canadian I desperately wanted to see them succeed, I didn&#8217;t hold out much hope.

Well, I guess that lack of faith is why I was swinging by in my wife&#8217;s Toyota Highlander and the other guy with BBRY10 on his licence plate was behind the wheel of a brand new Lamborghini.

My old man, who is also known to dabble in the market a little, even gave me the heads up about BBRY when it still didn&#8217;t have two digits in the handle.  I went to the Rogers store across the street and decided to check it out for myself.

Although it was a decent phone, I couldn&#8217;t get around the fact that there were basically no decent apps.  Yes, I appreciated that the typing recognition was probably the best I had ever seen.  Yes, the performance was snappy.  Yes, it definitely was not a stinker, but was it enough to save BBRY?

I didn&#8217;t hold out hope.  I thought who is going to buy this phone when they can choose the Android or even iPhone with the gazillion apps?

Well, I was wrong.  It turns out that more people were much more faithful than me, and were going to stick by their Blackberry.  The sales have been much better than I would have ever thought.

Not only that, I have noticed a very definite change in attitude amongst people I quiz about their perception of Blackberry.  It is actually developing a little bit of a cool factor.  I would have never guessed that in a million years.  Young people are talking about getting one to replace their aging iPhones.

But not only is it winning new converts, there is also a massive amount of built up demand for people who have refused to give up their keyboards.  Everywhere I go there are still the remaining die hards who won&#8217;t convert to touch screens.  This upcoming new Blackberry with the keyboard is going to be way more of a success than investors believe.  Given that there hasn&#8217;t been a decent new Blackberry with a keyboard in years, the amount of upgrades is going to be astronomical.

And then finally, my last reason for owning the stock is that I have concluded that Blackberry will be the number three competitor for some time to come.  I hold no illusions that they might be able to return to their former glory on the top of the smart phone pile.  That is not going to happen.  However, a solid number three is all you need.  I was concerned that Windows phone would displace Blackberry, but given the terrible execution out of Microsoft, I do not believe that this going to happen.  In fact, my guess is that Microsoft eventually buys Blackberry. _ [  just a quick aside &#8211; if you think about this, BBRY is the perfect target for MSFT.  BBRY is highly valued by the enterprise customer due to its security.  MSFT is increasingly relying on the enterprise as Apple and other more innovative companies steal mindshare away in the consumer space.  MSFT buying BBRY is a perfect fit. ]_

_I_ think that BBRY is going to surprise many investors as it cements its place as the number three smartphone maker.  There is an outside shot they get acquired, but even if they don&#8217;t, the built up demand for the new phone and the increasing acceptance amongst the &#8216;cool crowd&#8217; of the Blackberry phone means that I might not be too late for my super car upgrade&#8230;
