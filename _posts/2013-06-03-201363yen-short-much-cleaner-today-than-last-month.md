A couple of weeks ago as the USDJPY skidded through 100.00 and quickly jumped up to 104, I got nervous about my Yen shorts.  I covered it all and was actually lucky enough to institute a short in the Nikkei, which although I had to suffer through a couple of days of immense pain as the &#8216;buy Nikkei short Yen&#8217; trade exploded higher, I was rewarded as the Nikkei came crashing down.

My main concern about the Yen was that the trade was extremely crowded with fast money macro tourist types.  I was getting emails from my usual &#8216;stock only&#8217; trading pals inquiring about the best way to play Japan.  There was also some smart guys who were predicting that the Japanese would lose control of the situation and the Yen would explode all the way to 110 or 120, thus triggering a global financial disaster.  Whenever you get &#8216;disaster&#8217; calls, you have to think about covering.

And my final straw for covering was that the Japanese government gave signals that they were happiest with the Yen at 100 USDJPY, and wanted the decline to stop.

The conditions were ripe for a consolidation / correction, and we are now two weeks into this much needed breather.  In the process we have drifted back down to 100.37 in the USDJPY pair.

When we first blew through 100.00 I told my co-worker Ryan that we would get another chance at par.  That seemed like a dumb call at the time because it was 101 before I could get the prediction out of my mouth, but here we are today, challenging that par level.

I think we are going to go back down below par, but I am not sure about that, so I am going to start initiating the short position in the Yen today.  I am going to short half the position in here at 100.37, and will put on the other half somewhere below par.

I think that although the Japanese government does not want the Yen selling to get out of control, nor do they want the decline to be retraced too much.  They indicated that par was a good level, so I believe they will actively defend this level.

We have also shaken out a lot of weak players.  Although the Nikkei is still up a long way, the damage in the Nikkei for the late longs has been especially brutal.

The trade is much &#8216;cleaner&#8217; today than last month.
