As a trader it is very easy to put on a position and then seek out stories / research pieces that agree with your position.  The problem of continually reinforcing your belief through selective reading is a very common pitfall.

As a habit I try to read pieces that disagree with my views.  If the writer is a person who I respect, I spend a very large amount of time questioning whether I might be mistaken.

Jeff Matthews is one of these people and he wrote an article titled _[The Most Important Article you didn&#8217;t read today: ](http://jeffmatthewsisnotmakingthisup.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-most-important-article-you-didnt.html)_

>   The most important article you didn’t bother reading today appears in the Wall Street Journal, and it looks like this:

> <span class="s1">  </span>The reason it is the most important article in today’s Wall Street Journal is the undeniable fact it reports, which is that after much hemming and hawing, Spain’s banks are now, finally, blowing out bad real estate to bottom-feeding hedge funds.

>  And so the healing has begun in the Spanish real estate market, which is to the E.U. as Florida, Phoenix and Southern California are to the United States.

>  What with the U.K. economy already catching fire—believe me, it’s on fire: just look at the data—today<span class="s2">’s</span> report makes our previous look at the stodgy crowd-think-gussied-up-as-economic-analysis from the IMF (see “[<span class="s3">Headlines That Make You Just Want to Run Out And Buy As If Your Life Depended On It</span>](http://jeffmatthewsisnotmakingthisup.blogspot.com/2013/08/headlines-that-make-you-just-want-to.html)”) seem too mild.

>  We would, as the saying goes, bet dollars to donuts that the IMF, which only last week provided that gloomy, never-getting-better prognostication for Spain’s economy, will be proven gloriously wrong.

>  Buy Spain, buy it now.

As you know, I am short Europe and therefore am very concerned when I see smart guys like Jeff Matthews recommending long positions.

I am even more concerned when the market does not seem to agree with me:

And to compound my worries is the fact that the Citibank Economic Surprise Index for the Eurozone is rising (this index measures the economic releases versus expectations):

There can be no denying that my short Europe call so far is wrong.  I must accept that and by no means will I add to the position.

The only question is whether I should be covering the position or not.

Although I understand why Jeff Matthews might be buying Spain, I still believe that the Eurozone as a whole will suffer from the most relatively tight Central Bank.  Until I see this change, I believe I should give the position a little longer to play out.

There is a decent chance that Matthews&#8217; view is what has been driving the rally so far.  If his opinion is consensus, then we are probably approaching a point where all the good news is fully baked in.  Have a look at this reporting from FT:

> _&#8230;global investors surveyed were their most bullish about world economic prospects since December 2009 and reported their highest exposure to eurozone stocks since January 2008, according to BofA Merrill Lynch._

> _Exposure to UK stocks was the highest since December 2002. In contrast, emerging market equity exposures fell to the lowest since August’s survey showed_ **_88 per cent of European fund managers expected the eurozone economy to strengthen in the year ahead, twice the level recorded last month_** _and the highest since February 2004._

I think that there has been a bit of a scramble out of the BRICS into developed markets and that Europe has probably outperformed unjustly.

However, I will continue to watch for articles that disagree with my thesis.
