Yesterday David Einhorn, who I believe to be one of the greatest investors of all time, filed suit against the company that represents his biggest holding.  His firm, Greenlight Capital, sued Apple in a technical manoeuvre to try to get Apple to return some of the $137 billion in cash that is sitting on their balance sheet. In an open letter to investors Einhorn wrote:

> “We understand that many of our fellow shareholders share our frustration with Apple’s capital allocation policies,” Greenlight said in an open letter to investors. “Apple has $145 per share of cash on its balance sheet. As a shareholder, this is your money.”

Later in the day Apple responded to Einhorn&#8217;s suit by saying that they would examine the proposal, but they were already on top of it:

> “By early last year, Apple’s cash balance had built to a point beyond what we needed to run our business and maintain flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities, so we announced a plan to return $45 billion to shareholders over three years. As of next week we will have executed $10 billion of that plan.  Apple’s management team and Board of Directors have been in active discussions about returning additional cash to shareholders. As part of our review, we will thoroughly evaluate Greenlight Capital’s current proposal to issue some form of preferred stock.”

The stock, which had sagged after some initial excitement in the morning on the Einhorn news exploded higher at this development. and closed at the high of the day.

I have not traded AAPL much over the last month, preferring to wait for an opportunity.  I had previously thought it was over owned, over hyped and most likely destined to settle down from the previously crazy volatility.

My current belief is that AAPL has entered into a new range roughly between $450 to $650 that will hold the stock to these levels for years to come.  I think that AAPL will be dead money when compared to the previous high rolling days of annualized 100% stock returns, but at the same time, neither will it collapse as many AAPL bears predict.

Given that Einhorn seems to have struck a nerve with management regarding the excess cash on the balance sheet, I believe that Tim Cook and the rest of Apple management will work hard to try to get their recent stock price sag to stop.

Yesterday I decided to put my money where my mouth is.  I started a naked put position on the March 475s.  I believe that Apple will slowly grind higher and that the bottom of my predicted range will hold.

Einhorn is not selling, but instead, sticking with the position and trying to make it work.

Given that the sentiment is no longer frothy, and you could almost argue that the bears are a little too confident, I am going to take a stab on the long side of AAPL.
