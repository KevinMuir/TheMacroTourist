If you are at all following markets you know that every remark from a Fed Governor and every economic release is being scrutinized as to how much to discount the possibility of the Fed tapering.&nbsp;

I think it is a foregone conclusion that they will taper in September or October &#8211; the Fed has given way too many signals to turn back. &nbsp;Unless we have a major market dislocation between now and then, you should expect the Federal Reserve to announce a reduction in the amount of bond buying at one of the next couple of meetings.

But let&#8217;s stop and really think about what the taper means. &nbsp;They are not suggesting that they will **sell** assets to shrink their balance sheet. &nbsp;Nor are they suggesting that they will **stop buying** and let the balance sheet shrink naturally. &nbsp;No, what they are suggesting is that they will **merely slow down** the rate at which they are expanding their balance sheet.__&nbsp;__

The fact that the markets are acting so skittish regarding the Fed tapering is more related to their massively overbought nature than whether it will dramatically affect the economy. &nbsp;We are probably going to go from $85 billion of purchases a month to $65 or $60 billion. &nbsp;Do you really think that is the reason that stocks have sold off so hard? &nbsp;&nbsp;

I think the Fed tapering excuse is horseshit and just makes interesting TV discussions for networks desperate to have an easy to draw conclusion about why stocks are selling off.&nbsp;

As I have outlined in previous posts, I am much more worried about the Emerging Markets sell off and the continued China rebalancing. &nbsp;These are real economic forces that have the potential to dramatically affect the world economy.

However, I will admit there is one other US monetary influence that I feel might be contributing to this sell off. &nbsp;

Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke has indicated that he does not want to continue as Chairman and it is widely expected that Obama will nominate a successor in the coming months. &nbsp;At first it seemed like Janet Yellen was a lock for the nomination. &nbsp;Although I think she is probably the best choice, it has been increasingly apparent that she is not Obama&#8217;s first choice. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t want to go into the politics about this decision, but I must admit that I was quite surprised to read about the women who have claimed that the Obama administration is not that friendly to the gentler gender. &nbsp;Regardless of why Yellen is not Barry&#8217;s first pick, it is what it is and the market needs to discount the most likely successor&#8217;s policies.&nbsp;

For whatever reason, it appears that Obama is going to nominate Larry Summers. &nbsp;It is reported that people either love or hate this guy &#8211; there is very little middle ground. &nbsp;Put me in the &#8216;he is a douchebag&#8217; camp. &nbsp;However, regardless of what you think of him, as traders it is our job to figure out where a &#8220;Summer&#8217;s Federal Reserve&#8221; is going to take monetary policy.&nbsp;

There is no doubt that Summers is much more a fan of fiscal stimulus and believes that monetary stimulus has been over used. &nbsp;Therefore it is safe to assume that a Summer&#8217;s Fed would be considerably less dovish when it comes to monetary policy than a Yellen Fed.

To me, the next Federal Reserve Chairman has considerably more effect on the market than whether they are going to taper next month. &nbsp;We are talking about the possibility of a complete shift in direction. &nbsp;We could go from zero per cent over night rates and $85 billion a month of balance sheet expansion to 1% over nights with no balance sheet expansion.&nbsp;

This is a big deal and deserves much more credit for the recent market swoon than the tapering.&nbsp;

It is also consistent with Obama&#8217;s recent speeches where he has emphasized:&nbsp;

> “We have to turn the page on the bubble-and-bust mentality that created this mess,”

**__**

Whether the Fed cuts the bond buying by $20 billion a month is inconsequential versus the possibility that the President and the new Federal Reserve Chairman completely change the economic policy course.

I am not judging whether it is right or wrong. &nbsp;It really doesn&#8217;t matter what I think about it. &nbsp;My job is simply to discount the different outcome possibilities. &nbsp;To me, this is much more important than the market realizes.&nbsp;
