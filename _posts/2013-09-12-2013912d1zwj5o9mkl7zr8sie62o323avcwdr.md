I think every 40 year old Bay street guy likes to think about himself as quite the partier.  They all imagine themselves as cool yet sophisticated pseudo alcoholics.  Kind of like Mickey Rourke in 9 1/2 weeks &#8211; you know the slick, good looking Mickey Rourke, not the current fat weird Mickey Rourke.

As my wife likes to remind me, I am no Mickey Rourke and if there was a movie character that would best describe my personality it would probably be Michael Anthony Hall in Sixteen Candles  (don&#8217;t be too quick to knock him &#8211; he has quite a reputation as a major dude within the geeks).

Anyways, this is a long and convoluted way of saying that I am no partier and that I err on the side about worrying about stuff while most others are just enjoying the party.   Usually I end up leaving the party way before anyone else &#8211; after all a good night&#8217;s sleep is hugely important!

Right now we are in the midst of quite the party in equities.  It is not yet the swinging from the chandeliers party of the 1990s DotCom bubble or the naked cannonballs into the pool party of the 2000s real estate mania, but it is definitely a decent party nonetheless.

Now some may argue with me that the current equity market is well supported by fundamentals and that stocks are not that expensive.

I am not going to bother getting into a valuation argument.  Five years into this bull market, I believe we are very much over extended and that stocks are increasingly getting priced for perfection.

I think the best argument is for me to just list the expected returns of various asset classes by probably the best macro fundamental analysis firm out there &#8211; GMO:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/jdjkhjdkh%20Sep%2012%2013.jpg" />

You will notice that they have **negative expected returns **for US large and small cap stocks.

Although GMO is not afraid to go swim against the tide &#8211; this sort of forecast is very unpopular right now.

Everyone is feeling great that stocks are pushing up towards new highs.  It seems like that after many years of sluggish growth, maybe, just maybe, the US economy is finally turning the corner and returning to the good old days of sustainable economic growth,.

We are in one of those periods where the risks are being ignored.

The party is quickly gaining momentum and no one wants to think about the consequences if the cops show up.

I see signs of this everywhere I look in the stock market.  Momo stocks like TSLA, BIDU, AMZN, FB are encouraging the aggressive traders to buy every dip as new highs are just around the corner.  Money management is getting thrown out the window as who needs money management when all you need to do is buy the dip.  This strategy is so popular that it has even developed its own acronym &#8211; BTFD (I will leave it to you to figure out the extra letter).  Old fogeys like Carl Icahn are instantly adding billions of market cap to the world&#8217;s largest stock through their random tweets about their holdings.

However, in the doorway, getting ready to leave the party are boring geeky guys like Jeremy Grantham from GMO, or Howard Marks, or Stanley Druckenmiller.  All of these guys are legends in the investing community and they are all worried about the excessive risk taking that is happening.

I have not yet spoken about the fact that the world&#8217;s largest corporate bond issue was floated by Verizon yesterday.  In 2007, the then largest bond offering for the TXU leveraged buy out marked the top in the market.  Those bonds eventually went for 30 cents on the dollar when the party had finally ended.

I know that many will think that I am boring and a complete goof for being worried about what might go wrong.  However, I am happy to pack up and hear about the rest of the party on Monday morning.  Don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you.
