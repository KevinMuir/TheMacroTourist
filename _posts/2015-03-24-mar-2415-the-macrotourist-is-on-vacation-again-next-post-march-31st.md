The MacroTourist&#8217;s oldest daughter is returning from a couple of weeks in Africa on a high school volunteer trip, and the whole family is headed to the airport to pick her up. So there will be no post today.

On her trip she was busy building a school and planting trees &#8211; generally learning how to be twice the human being I will ever hope to be. Therefore, I feel her good Samaritan behaviour makes up for my skipping out of town later in the week for my annual backcountry CAT skiing trip in the British Columbia interior with my equally undeserving and obnoxious Bay street pals.

There will be no posts until Tuesday March 31st. 

Thanks for reading and good luck trading,
