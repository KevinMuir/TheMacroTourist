The Federal Reserve has followed through and met the expectations of the numerous Wall Street economists who have been forecasting that the Fed would expand their purchases of Treasury Bonds at the expiration of Operation Twist.  The Fed announced QE 4, which will take the form of an additional $45 billion of long term Treasury purchases per month.

Given Wall Street&#8217;s nearly unanimous view that this would be announced today, this was not a surprise for the market.  However, the Fed did surprise everyone by accelerating their decision to provide quantitative guidance on when the extraordinarily accommodative stimulus would be removed.  This was widely expected to be tackled in the new year at a future meeting.

Here is the section of the Fed announcement that is most important as it was unexpected by the market:

> <p class="p1">
>   In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.

>     I have not yet thought through all the implications, but my initial thoughts are that this might backfire on the Fed.  The Fed has been committed to providing monetary stimulus for as long as the economy continues to not provide the desired job growth.  Before this announcement, the decision about what constitutes adequate job growth was a qualitative decision made by the Federal Open Market Committee.  With this new decision, the timing for raising rates is no longer  a judgement call, but now simply a follow through on a promise.  Same goes for inflation expectations.  With this new Fed policy, a sudden increase in inflation expectations will now force the Federal Reserve to raise rates.

>     The US dollar is broad asset class that seems to have reacted the most violently.  The EUR and CHF especially have rallied the most.  EUR has blasted higher by 70 pips and is pushing back to the long term high of 1.31  that over the couple of months has proven to be formidable resistance.  You can see from this chart of the DXY index (Dollar Index) that the initial reaction was to sell US dollars aggressively:

>     Although I agree that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s purchase of Treasury Bonds is actually bond market unfriendly (the expansion of the balance sheet increases money supply, thus increasing inflation, ultimately causing bonds to go down), usually the market is not nearly as forward looking.  A more typical response to the news of a QE program would be for investors to believe they can front run the Fed&#8217;s buying which causes a rally in the bond market.

>     I believe that this might be because investors, who have thus far simply bought bonds with a belief that the Fed would keep interest rates at zero forever, might for the first time in a long time, suddenly be waking up to the fact that the possibility of the Fed raising rates is higher than they previously believed.  It wouldn&#8217;t take much to move inflation expectations over the range that the Fed has indicated would cause the removal of its highly accommodative stance.

>     This line of thinking is obviously in direct contradiction to what the gold, stock and foreign exchange markets are currently pricing in.  Their reactions are indicating that they think the Fed will print forever.  However, the bond market is often the market that seems to &#8216;figure it out&#8217; the fastest.
