As you know, I have been bullish on equities over the last couple of months.  Last week I started gingerly reducing my exposure, mainly out of prudence as it had been a good win.  Today I am officially moving to a neutral position on North American equities (I am still quite bearish on European equities).

### Why the shift?

I fear the market is getting ahead of itself.  Have a look at the AAII US Investor Sentiment Bullish reading:

You will notice that the percentage of bulls is now over 50%, with a sharp increase in the past month.  This makes me worried.

During this period the market has gone up in a relentless grinding fashion:

There has barely been a down day, forget about a meaningful correction.  It has not allowed any of the bears to cover and this has caused a fair amount of &#8216;just get me in&#8217; covering.

In my estimation, this rally has been hated and faded aggressively, but the tone has shifted lately and now, the bulls are becoming a little too emboldened.

### What also scares me?

There has been a lack of confirmation from fundamental indicators.

This morning we had the Initial Jobless claims release.  It unexpectedly rose to 368k instead of the 350k that was forecast.  The stock market seems to follow the inverse of this figure quite closely:

Over time, this indicator seems to be a remarkably prescient reflection of the S&P 500. So when the two diverge, it might be a one off blip like we saw in November, or it might be an indicator that stocks are due to pull back.  Have a look at the chart in a shorter time frame:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/SPX%20vs%20Init%20Claim%20ST%20Jan%2031%2013.gif" />

Stocks (the yellow line) are running way ahead of claims.  Now maybe claims will reverse next week, but then again, maybe stocks will &#8216;correct&#8217; the divergence.

And it is not just initial jobless claims that is worrying me.  Have a look at the S&P vs the Consumer Confidence number:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/SPX%20vs%20Cons%20Confidence%20Jan%2031%2013.gif" />

Again, the S&P is taking off, yet the consumer confidence is slumping lower.

The best bull markets get overbought and stay overbought &#8211; never making it easy for investors to climb on board.  There is often no easy correction to buy.  I am not advocating shorting this market as there is a decent chance that the Fed&#8217;s printing will overwhelm these worries that I have.

At the same time, I can no longer advocate an aggressive long position.  There is simply too much evidence that sentiment is getting stretched, while at the same time, the fundamentals are not confirming the bull move.

I would love to see a 5% to 10% correction that really scares these newly minted bulls.  Just enough to shake them out of their positions.  But for now, I am moving to neutral.
