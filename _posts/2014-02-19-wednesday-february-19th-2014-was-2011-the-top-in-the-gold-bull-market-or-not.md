I apologize for the lack of posts during the past few days. We decided to make an extra long Family Day long week-end and although I had plans to try to write an entry or two from the lake, as John Lennon said, &#8220;life is what happens when you have plans to post updates to the internet&#8230;&#8221;

While I was busy slacking, the precious metals bull move has continued, and is now gathering some momentum. The financial media, who at the end of last year as the precious metals were getting slaughtered in a brutal year end tax selling swoon were all too eager to write article after article about why precious metals were such a terrible long term investment, have now gone strangely quiet. I don&#8217;t see the same fervour to help investors pitch this terrible relic from their portfolios. Funny how that works&#8230;

In hindsight trades are always obvious, but this one was easy enough that even I was able to get it right. I was fortunate enough to realize that the sentiment at the end of the year was _so bad,_ that the bottom was at hand. Since that time, I have been long, and although I have not been smart enough to aggressively add to it, I have also fought my urge to take profits prematurely.

Many market watchers like to focus on the near term lines and squiggles. Although I like to use these shorter term indicators to help with timing, my focus is trying to get the medium to longer term direction right, and then hope that I can hold on for the ride.

So while many gold bulls are fixating on the break out from $1280, and then looking at the resistance at $1360, I am asking myself a bigger picture question.

For me, there is one important question that I want answered. **Was the 2011 top the end of a 10 year bull market?**

Going into 2011, there is no doubt that the gold market was extremely over extended. It was a hedge fund favourite, which for me is always a warning sign. The gold miners were lifting hedges, and expanding output at the fastest rate possible. Everyone _knew_ that gold had only one way to go.<figure id="attachment_14651" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

And then in September of 2011, the top was quietly made. Gold did not have some big three day monster 30% up move like during the 1980 top. No, it just rolled over and started heading lower.

At first it looked like it was only a healthy correction to the $1600 level, where it stabilized and went sideways for the next year and a half.<figure id="attachment_14661" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

At this point, the market action seemed healthy and it looked like the correction would be limited to a couple hundred dollars and a couple of years of sideways returns.

Then, during the past year, the bottom fell out.<figure id="attachment_14681" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-14681" alt="GOLDYearFeb1914.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/GOLDYearFeb1914.png" width="600" height="343" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GOLDYearFeb1914-300x171.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GOLDYearFeb1914.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/GOLDYearFeb1914.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Gold &#8211; after a couple of years of sideways action, the bottom falls out</figcaption></figure> 

The $1600 support level gave way, and in a sickening woosh, gold fell to $1200.

Although there was some disorderly liquidation for a couple of days during March of 2013, there was really no &#8220;crash&#8221;.

**But I still haven&#8217;t answered the question about the 2011 top. Was it &#8220;the top&#8221; or not?**

I don&#8217;t actually have a clue. But I think it is the most important question that the gold bulls should be asking themselves.

If the gold bears are correct, then the 2011 top was &#8220;the top&#8221; in a precious metals mania. To these bears, the gold bull market of 2001-2011 resembles the Nasdaq bubble of 1990s.<figure id="attachment_14691" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-14691" alt="NDXFeb1914.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/NDXFeb1914.png" width="600" height="383" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/NDXFeb1914-300x191.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/NDXFeb1914.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/NDXFeb1914.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Nasdaq during the dot com bubble</figcaption></figure> 

And if they are correct in their analysis that the &#8220;bubble&#8221; has popped, then you need to be very aware of what happens after the popping of bubbles. There is always a bounce, but then they go **_nowhere_** for a _long, long time._<figure id="attachment_14701" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-14701" alt="NDXLTFeb1914.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/NDXLTFeb1914.png" width="600" height="383" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/NDXLTFeb1914-300x191.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/NDXLTFeb1914.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/NDXLTFeb1914.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Nasdaq &#8211; sideways for a decade after the popping of the bubble</figcaption></figure> 

So, going back to gold, yes, we have had a bounce off the lows. Over the last couple of months a small bull move has developed.

But, is this simply just a retracement from the bigger long term top? Or was the move from $1900 to $1200 a correction in a bigger move that will ultimately move it to new highs?<figure id="attachment_14671" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-14671" alt="GOLDRetrFeb1914.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/GOLDRetrFeb1914.png" width="600" height="385" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GOLDRetrFeb1914-300x192.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GOLDRetrFeb1914.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/GOLDRetrFeb1914.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Gold chart with retracement levels</figcaption></figure> 

I realize that I am not really saying much in this post. I am not sticking my neck out and telling you convincingly that gold is headed to new highs, or alternatively that this is just a bounce after the 2011 top.

The truth is that I don&#8217;t know, and if somebody tells you that they know, ask them what they were telling everyone when gold was $1900. Or what they were telling everyone at $1200. Chances are that anyone with a big conviction either way has not changed their views one iota during the last $700 move.

I try to be much more pragmatic. Although I am sympathetic to the possibility that there is a decent chance that the necessary ingredients are in place for a violent move higher, at the same time I would have never guessed that we would have hit $1200 and I have been dead wrong in the extent that gold went down in 2013.

I am torn about whether the 2011 was the top. It certainly didn&#8217;t feel like a blow off top. There was no dot com like fever with the retail investor. There were no lines outside precious metal stores like in 1980. There was no monster high volatility move higher. No, it just quietly rolled over.

There is nothing saying that there _has to be a blow off top._ But given the massive bull market of the last decade, a blow off top certainly seemed like a more likely ending to the bull market.

For now, I am going to reserve judgement and stay long. If 2011 was the top, then it is very likely that we will rally up into resistance and peter out. Rallies will be opportunities to lighten up as opposed to doubling down. So far, on a longer term time frame, this rally from $1200 to $1320 is quite small. We could easily rally up to $1425 and still be in a bear market.

But as we rally, make sure you ask yourself what you think the chances were that 2011 was the top. If you think that the chances are high, then make sure you sell into the rally. As for me, I am unsure and will cross that bridge when we get there.

**Positions**

**Short Nasdaq 100 futures, short Eurostoxx futures, and short Nikkei futures.  **I entered the trade last Wednesday with idea that the Fed is going to taper until something breaks and that the bulls are pushing their luck.  Although I was looking like I might be correct for about 5 minutes, the mighty bull beast has re-emerged and is testing my resolve.  For now, I hang tight.  Conviction 4.  No stops for now

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index vs Long S&P 500.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities.   Conviction 5

**Short Euro.  **Not much to say, I didn&#8217;t enter this trade very well, but I still think the Euro works it way lower in coming months. Conviction 4

****Short Yen.****  Establish short Yen last week.  Now I will sit tight and wait.  Conviction 4

**Short JGB futures.  **I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
