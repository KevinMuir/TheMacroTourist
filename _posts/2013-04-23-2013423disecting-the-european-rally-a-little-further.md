I must admit to being completely surprised at the violence of today&#8217;s move in European stock indices. &nbsp;

  * Stoxx 50 up 3.07%
  * CAC up 3.58%
  * DAX up 2.41%
  * IBEX up 3.26%
  * Italy up 2.93%

Although I at first thought it was&nbsp;attributable&nbsp;to two factors &#8211; a preponderance of shorts combined with an increased likelihood of an ECB rate cut, I believe a third and more important factor played the greatest role.&nbsp;

There has been a lot of increased chatter from ECB and EU officials that seem to indicate that they realize that their austerity programs are not working. &nbsp;This morning in the Guardian, there was the following article that has many investors wondering if the Europeans are about to turn over a new leaf:

> _&#8220;Socially and politically, one policy that is only seen as austerity is, of course, not sustainable,&#8221; Barroso said. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t done everything right â€¦ The policy has reached its limits because it has to have a minimum of political and social support.&#8221;_

> _His comments follow last week&#8217;s intervention on UK economic policy by the IMF. Its chief, Christine Lagarde, said the poor performance of the UK economy left her with no alternative but to urge George Osborne to revisit his austerity policy._

> _Barroso&#8217;s remarks were a rare admission from Brussels that its policy prescriptions, mainly crafted by eurozone governments with Berlin in the driving seat, for dealing with the crisis of the past three years had either been flawed or were running out of steam. He added that in the quest to pull the eurozone back into growth, there was no point in piling up more debt. &#8220;Growth based on debt is unsustainable, artificial. That&#8217;s the biggest lesson of the crisis,&#8221; he said._

> _Barroso&#8217;s unusual critique of German-driven austerity policies, particularly in the eurozone and in bailed-out countries, came as one of the biggest players in the bond markets also called for a relaxation of Berlin-style fiscal rigour._

> _Bill Gross, manager of Pimco, the world&#8217;s biggest bond fund, said: &#8220;The UK and almost all of&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;have erred in terms of believing that austerity, fiscal austerity in the short term, is the way to produce real growth. It is not.&#8221; In an interview with the Financial Times, he added: &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to spend money.&#8221;_

My whole premise for my short thesis on European equities was that the officials &#8216;just didn&#8217;t get it.&#8217; &nbsp;They seemed intent on following through on the German hard money / austerity programs regardless of the consequences. &nbsp;

**If they have indeed changed their minds about the wisdom of these policies, then I am forced to abandon my bias against their stock markets.&nbsp;**&nbsp;Now, one article does not make a change in policy, but the simple fact that this article is getting floated out there shows that the Europeans might be in the process of blinking. &nbsp;

Regardless of whether the Europeans actually follow through, traders like me that had counted on them to maintain overly tight (for their economies) monetary and fiscal policies were now forced to discount a decreased probability of that outcome. &nbsp;This was the cause of much of today&#8217;s rally. &nbsp;

Do I think they are going to actually change anything? &nbsp;Probably not. &nbsp;However, I need to acknowledge that the odds have now changed and trade accordingly. &nbsp;I will be watching very closely for signs of whether they follow through on this issue. &nbsp;It is the key to which way Europe goes from here&#8230;
