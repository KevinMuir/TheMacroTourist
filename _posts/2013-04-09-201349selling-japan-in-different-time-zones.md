I don&#8217;t usually repost entire blog posts, but I think this latest one by Zero Hedge deserves some discussion:

> While the dominant flow of policy action from the Japanese has, until last week, been of the jawboning variety, the actual selling pressure on the rapidly devaluing currency has come from foreign sources. As the following chart shows, the last few months have seen not Mrs Watanabe _(euphemistically selling her JPY to find better returns elsewhere)_ but the likes of Mr. Soros and Mr. Bass who see the endgame disorderly collapse of a currency (or perhaps it is the rest of the G7 central bankers unwinding JPY-based reserves to &#8216;help&#8217; their fellow central planner out). The **bulk of JPY selling pressure has come during non-Tokyo trading hours**, as the Japanese, until last week at least, appear much more timid about Abenomics&#8217; chances of success.

Zero Hedge has highlighted what I believe is one of the most important points about the last couple of months of trading.  There is a tremendous amount of speculation occurring by hedge funds and other investors / speculators.  The Bank of Japan is not responsible for the majority of this movement so far.  The market has simply front run where the Bank of Japan has signalled where it would like the markets to go.

What scares me is that at some point there speculators will want to ring the register.  At that point we could be very surprised at how quickly the market reverses the move.  I hate trades that are crowded with tons of hedge funds.  I have lost more money on these types of crowded trades than anything else&#8230;  actually that might not be true, I have lost of money lots of different ways&#8230;  let&#8217;s just say that I find it difficult to make money in trades dominated with hedge funds.

This post by ZH proves what I suspected, but it is good to see it demonstrated empirically.  I continue to believe that the Nikkei stock index is way ahead of itself, and that the JGB market might in fact be the best short of the Japanese short sandwich.
