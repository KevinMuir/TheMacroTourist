I love to catch falling knives. Over the years I have lost a few fingers, but I enjoy it too much to give it up.

Although I am the first one to give catching a collapsing stock a whirl, I am not going to even think about touching the &#8220;cult&#8221; stocks that are getting decimated today.

I have been warning about my Four Horseman stocks (TSLA, NFLX, FB, LNKD) and the other group of &#8220;cult&#8221; stocks that Jim Cramer claimed were &#8220;going to continue their rally&#8221; because of their loyal following.

We have not seen stocks this egregiously overbought since the home builders were a &#8220;can&#8217;t lose&#8221; trade in 2007. 

Today, the bloom has come off the rose. There has been no real catalyst. Some will blame the budget impasse. Some will come up with some other excuse, like managers were selling stocks to make room for Twitter. 

It doesn&#8217;t really matter. It was going to happen. These stocks were just stupidly over extended.

Let&#8217;s have a look at the carnage. First, here is my Four Horseman index over the last month:

And here is Cramer&#8217;s &#8220;Cult&#8221; stocks that were destined to continue their rally:

You will notice that although today feels terrible, these indexes are still up on the month. 

And when you step back and look at the long term picture, today&#8217;s moves are still minor. Here is the Four Horseman index over 6 months:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/FOURLTOct08013.gif" alt="FOURLTOct08013" title="FOURLTOct08013.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

And Cramer&#8217;s &#8220;cult&#8221; stocks:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/CULTLTOct0813.gif" alt="CULTLTOct0813" title="CULTLTOct0813.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

So although it seems like today is vastly oversold on a short term time frame, these moves are quite small in the bigger picture.

Today is merely the _first big down day_. It never makes sense to try to catch the first big down day. It is _never the last big down day._

If you insist on trying to catch these names now, you aren&#8217;t going to lose just fingers, but you stand a good chance of pulling a Luke Skywalker and losing your whole hand.
