> &#8220;Here&#8217;s a nightmare portfolio I&#8217;m about to rescue from a deranged advisor.&#8221; &#8211; Downtown Josh Brown ‏@ReformedBroker &#8211; January 8th, 2014

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter" style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="Bdes1RXIUAAlDRa.jpg-large.jpeg" alt="Bdes1RXIUAAlDRa jpg large" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/Bdes1RXIUAAlDRa.jpg-large.jpeg" width="450" height="600" border="0" />
</p>

Last week, John Brown, the writer of the Reformed Broker blog and now regular CNBC &#8220;Fast Money&#8221; trader tweeted the above embarrassing portfolio that he had inherited from what I can only surmise is a pretty disappointed investor.

I really like Josh and find him to be one of the more witty, humble and general all around good guys in the financial media. If I were Josh and this client came to me, I too would proceed to liquidate the portfolio and invest it using my own methodology (although I might not tweet his embarassment for everyone to see).

Apart from a good laugh at the ridiculousness of this portfolio, it&#8217;s worth it to stop and think about how this client got to this point, and if there is anything we can learn from his folly.

Let&#8217;s first review the top few holdings in this portfolio. Let&#8217;s start with the first one which weighs in at a whopping 20%+ of the portfolio. It is the GDX Market Vectors Junior Gold miners. To have 20% of your portfolio in a basket of Junior Gold miners is insane. It is even more insane when you realize the next 80% of the portfolio is probably just as risky. Here is the chart for this little gem of an ETF:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="GDXJJan1714.gif" alt="GDXJJan1714" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/GDXJJan1714.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">GDXJ &#8211; Market Vectors Junior Gold Miner ETF</figcaption></figure> 

The next biggest holding is the KOL Market Vectors Coal ETF &#8211; I guess he figured that the idea of clean burning coal made for a great contrarian play:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="KOLJan1714.gif" alt="KOLJan1714" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/KOLJan1714.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">KOL &#8211; Market Vectors Coal ETF</figcaption></figure> 

Now to his credit, he did have a little cash, so you have to at least say his wasn&#8217;t all in. But given the crazy nature of all of his holdings, the next biggest holding of 12% cash is probably still extremely insufficient.

After cash, the fourth biggest holding is the XME SPDR S&P Metal and Mining Shares:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="XMEJan1714.gif" alt="XMEJan1714" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/XMEJan1714.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">XME &#8211; SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF</figcaption></figure> 

And then we get to my favourite &#8211; the TMF Direxion Daily 20+ Year Bull 3X fund. This is a levered ETF which gave a return of 3X the 20 Year Treasury Index. The only people that should trade this crap is day traders &#8211; and even they should be weary. This is an absolutely asinine asset to hold in a client portfolio.  Anything with leverage simply gets chewed up as the asset swings around and the ETF is rebalanced &#8211; and 3X is especially stupid:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="TMFJan1714.gif" alt="TMFJan1714" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/TMFJan1714.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">TMF &#8211; Direxion Daily 20+Year Bull 3X &#8211; when you need three times the leverage on the Treasury Bond market!</figcaption></figure> 

Chart after chart of the assets in this portfolio looks like death.  No sense going through the rest of the names, they basically all look the same.

We recreated the portfolio in Bloomberg and tracked its performance over the last few years. Ready for it?<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="RIHTJan1714.gif" alt="RIHTJan1714" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/RIHTJan1714.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Performance of &#8220;the deranged portfolio&#8221;</figcaption></figure> 

This portfolio has been halved in the last year and a half.  It was pretty well the worst portfolio you could have for this period.

I have also highlighted the point at which Josh inherited this portfolio and most likely blew out the positions. This return represents a loss of 49% over the last few years, which is terrible. It is even worse when you consider that if the client had simply bought an S&P 500 index fund, he would have been up almost 45% over the same time period:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="SPXvsRIHTJan1714.gif" alt="SPXvsRIHTJan1714" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/SPXvsRIHTJan1714.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">S&P return in percentage terms (green line) vs Deranged Portfolio (white line)</figcaption></figure> 

So by any measure, this portfolio was a colossal failure.

Now I have had my share of bad calls. And in fact, although I was not a commodity bull at the height of its popularity (I was skeptical of the &#8220;China miracle&#8221;) I have made the mistake of assuming that the massive Quantitative Easing would find its way into assets that the Fed didn&#8217;t want (energy and food) and not into assets that they did want (real estate and stocks). I have therefore become bullish on too many of these same assets in this nightmare portfolio over the last year &#8211; which given the fact that they are mostly all on their lows, was one year too early.

But I am heartened by this tweet of Josh Brown&#8217;s and take solace that the bottom is probably much closer than we realize.

A few years ago, there was no doubt that the &#8220;China will grow at 10% forever and the Fed&#8217;s money printing will cause hyper inflation&#8221; was very popular and that those that invested based on this belief were making a lot of money.

There were many famous strategists that were advising a barbell approach.  They reasoned that the Western economies would never revive after the 2008 credit crisis, and therefore interest rates would stay low, making bonds a great investment.  On the other hand, the exact opposite was going occur in China, with growth never faltering and their demand for commodities continuing to be insatiable.  Long bonds and commodities was a very popular trade in 2011.

However, that trade hit its peak during the summer of 2011 and has been deflating ever since.

I have always been a big China skeptic, but even I would have never guessed the damage that would be done to this &#8220;barbell&#8221; portfolio.  I knew there was a lot of speculation, but the unwind has been spectacular.

The simple fact that anyone ever constructed a portfolio like the one Josh Brown is now liquidating that was so skewed towards this one &#8220;theme&#8221; shows that the greed was indeed extraordinary.

In trading, there is a cycle that markets work their way through:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter" style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="InvestorCycleJan2014.jpg" alt="InvestorCycleJan2014" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/InvestorCycleJan2014.jpg" width="510" height="271" border="0" />
</p>

Understanding where you are in this cycle is one of the keys to successful investing.

There can be no doubt that the &#8220;China will grow at 10% and the West will never revive&#8221; trade was a borderline mania. And now that we are skidding down the right side of the descending part of the curve, the question you need to ask is &#8211; where are we in this cycle?

If Josh Brown&#8217;s investor is typical, then his selling means that we have to be through denial &#8211; but are we at the fear, panic or contempt phase?

I would argue that we are squarely in the contempt phase. Why? The general attitude of the financial community that were bearish of the commodity trade is very smug. For those that were bullish, there is a bitterness and general disgust that I only recall seeing when the dot com bubble crashed.

Although Josh tweeted this portfolio to show what some insane advisors are capable of, if the psychology of the market towards these assets were not so contemptuous, then he probably wouldn&#8217;t have bothered. The prevailing attitude towards these assets &#8220;makes&#8221; the joke all the more funny.

Josh&#8217;s partner, Barry Ritholz, who again is a really good guy, felt secure enough to pen a 2,500 word article for the Washington Post titled &#8211; &#8220;Bitten by the gold bug? You&#8217;ll do well to heed the past&#8221;.

These are signs of the contempt for this asset class that is rifling through the investment community. We very well might go down from here, but I don&#8217;t think that is the right bet.

Back in the 1990s, I was the index arb trader for Canada&#8217;s largest dealer. We were continually providing markets in the various index products, and although the goal was to remain flat, as anyone who has ever provided liquidity knows, eventually one day when you are standing in there for a client, you get plugged and it just keeps going. When we would have a position that was going against us, we made all the same mistakes that traders make. At first we would hope it would bounce, then we buy a little more to improve our cost, and sometimes this would work and it would reinforce the bad habit of not taking the first loss. Until one day, you get a Long Term Capital crisis, and you get run over, and it just keeps going down and down and down. Then the risk management department, who is seeing the same thing happen on desk after desk, gives you a tap on the shoulder, and you are forced to blow out the whole position. Which you do &#8211; right at the lows.

Trading is all the same &#8211; only the time frame differs. This client with the insane portfolio probably bought more on the way down too. He also probably hit a point where he was mesmerized by fear and did not know what to do. **And then finally, when things were really bad, he decided to blow out his whole portfolio and let some nice guy that he saw on CNBC manage his money.**

What do you think the chances are that this was NOT the bottom in this guy&#8217;s portfolio?

Now, I am not suggesting that he should have held on &#8211; the answer to his problem was that he should have never owned this portfolio in the first place. **But as a market observer, I have to say that I have seen this play out too many times. He puked into the lows&#8230;

**Things that I am watching&#8230;**

**Insider Sales**

In my younger days I did some work in a Research Department and one of my menial jobs was to comb through the insider reports to highlight the more significant buys and sells. The one thing that I remember from this tedious work is that insider buys mean a lot more than insider sells. Insiders sell for a wide variety of reasons. They want to buy a new house, or a boat that they have always had their eye on. Or they are going through a divorce and need to sell. They also sell because they think the price might be going down, but there is **only one reason they buy.** They only buy when they think the price is going higher.

Insider buy signals are therefore much more accurate than sell signals.

Nevertheless, when the insider sell signals spike higher, you still have to ask yourself if maybe this time the signal might be a little more significant than just cashing out to buy a new boat (or to pay for a new wife):

**Positions**

**UPDATE: **Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story.   The stock is running like it stole something, and on Friday I peeled a bit off into the strength.  I see that a few brokers have picked up the story, and if I were to guess, they are trying to establish themselves for the next equity issuance.  Input is going to need capital to expand, so although I love the story, I would not add to it up here, and for a trading accounts, I would even lighten up a touch.  Wait for the next issue to buy again.  Conviction level: 5**

**UPDATE: Short S&P 500 into strength.**  We are so close to new highs that you need to steel yourself for the potential breakout, but I am not going to cover into any squeeze and will sit tight into new highs. ** I suspect if we do have a break out, it will be a last gasp.  Be ready for a &#8220;pop and drop&#8221;.  **Conviction: 4

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

**Short Canadian dollar.** CAD continues to quietly sink.  Conviction level: 4. Stops to come.  **Short CAD against JPY and EUR.**  Small position size.

**Long various natural gas contracts.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather. Conviction level: 3 No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** I am long bond market volatility as I think the next crisis will start in the bond market. Conviction level: 3.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5
