This morning the markets are finally getting the message that there won&#8217;t be a quick solution to the fiasco in Washington. I have been arguing this point for a while, so as the market begins to price in this realization, I am becoming less willing to stay as short as I have been. So I will once again pick away at my large short positions into this morning&#8217;s weakness (S&P 500 futures are down 16).

When I see Time covers like this:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/TimeOct0713.jpg" alt="TimeOct0713" title="TimeOct0713.jpg" border="0" width="461" height="600" />

I know that we are approaching a point where more and more worry is being priced into the market. 

Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am still very short, but at the margin, this morning, I will be a little less so.

Everyone is focusing on the predicted October 17th date that the US Treasury has been bandying about as some sort of end of the world date. If there is one thing that I have faith in the Americans, it is their ability to dream up some sort of financial engineering that will enable them to sidestep any self imposed debt limit. 

We all know about the so called &#8220;trillion dollar coin&#8221; that has been proposed as a solution. This solution has the US Treasury minting a special &#8220;trillion dollar coin&#8221; that is then monetized by the Federal Reserve. The reason that it sidesteps the debt ceiling is that currency is exempt from the debt limit. Therefore this trillion dollars will not count as an increase in the debt outstanding. Although this would indeed work from a technical point of view, I very much doubt that the Federal Reserve wants to be seen as even less independent than they already are. Not only that, Ben Bernanke has already plainly stated that the &#8220;trillion dollar coin&#8221; solution would not be be implemented by the Fed. I view the &#8220;trillion dollar coin&#8221; as a non-starter.

But, that doesn&#8217;t mean there aren&#8217;t other novel financial engineering solutions that could be implemented to avoid default. This one outlined by Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine would work perfectly:

I firmly believe that there are ways around the debt ceiling impasse. Never underestimate Goldman&#8217;s or JP Morgan&#8217;s ability to come up with some creative financing when there are fees on the line.

Remember that the debt ceiling is not some sort of ceiling imposed on the US by the market. No, the debt ceiling is completely self imposed. It is also completely arbitrary. Therefore using some novel financing method to bypass the restriction will not be viewed negatively by the market. Also it was only a week ago that the market assumed that a deal would be quickly reached, so having a financial engineering solution might even be cheered.

I believe that there are other long term issues that the market needs to deal with, but now that the market is becoming less optimistic about the possibility of a deal, I think the risk reward is slowly start to become less favourable for the shorts.
