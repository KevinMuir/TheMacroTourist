I don&#8217;t usually comment about where the markets are headed in the next few hours, but I today I am going to make an exception.

There are a confluence of different factors that make today a pretty decent bet on the upside.

  1. There is a massive $4.5 POMO scheduled for today.&nbsp;
  2. The day before Good Friday has been significantly positive over the last few decades.
  3. European markets are very oversold and due for a pause in their decline.
  4. The US market has pushed up towards new all time highs even with the Cyprus crisis. &nbsp;If that situation cools, then there is a decent chance that the US stock market will break out to new highs.

By no means am I getting bullish on a medium or long term basis, but for those day traders out there, it might be worth a shot with a blue ticket.</p>
