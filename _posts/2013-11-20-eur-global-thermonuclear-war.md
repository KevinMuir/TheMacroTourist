In War Games, the classic movie of my childhood, Ferris Bueller (before he was really Ferris Bueller) hacks into the US WOPR military super computer. It is a cheesy movie, but it sure seemed awesome at the time. To get a sense of the age of this movie, here is the screen he was presented with upon cracking into this &#8220;super&#8221; computer:

Pretty sweet graphics. I wonder if that was the retina display for its time.

Of course even though there are great games like Chess or Poker to choose from, Ferris (not really Ferris yet) chooses Global Thermonuclear War. One thing leads to another, and even though the computer&#8217;s graphics look like the resolution is 180 x 200 pixels, the artificial intelligence built into the computer is 10 times more advanced than anything we have today and the computer continues to phone Ferris so that they can play their game. Finally after the computer commences a simulation of a Russian nuclear attack on America, and the world is one step away from real global thermonuclear war, Ferris somehow convinces the US military to not respond because this is all a game. 

At the end, the computer understands that there are no winners in Global Thermonuclear War and says;

Well, today the ECB decided to engage in a little Global Thermonuclear War when they broke the last taboo of Central Banking and introduced the possibility of negative interest rates. 

In a surprising move, the ECB seems to be panicking and desperately trying to talk their currency down. They surprised the market last month with the discount rate cut. Over the last week they floated the idea of QE, but the market did not fall for that and the Euro continued to march higher. Now the ECB seem to have gone all in and decided to contemplate negative interest rates. 

Although there are a few smaller Central Banks that have experimented with negative rates, in terms of the majors, so far not even the Japanese have actually gone negative. The ECB would really be treading into uncharted territory if they went down this route.

Why would they be willing to do this? 

The answer is that they are scared. 

Have a look at inflation:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/EUCPINov2013.gif" alt="EUCPINov2013" title="EUCPINov2013.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

The horizontal line represents their target rate. You can see that during the mid 2000s it fluctuated evenly around 2%. There was a big move higher in 2007 which was partly caused by the energy spike, which then ushered in the tightening and the inevitable credit crash. CPI then pushed down into the scary negative zone, but with a lot of worldwide stimulus, the Central Banks of the world were able to prop it back up.

However, over the last year, inflation has been falling, and now looks like it is going to accelerate to the downside. Given the world&#8217;s massively over indebted nature, this is a huge burden for the global economy. 

The ECB has been the tightest Central Bank, allowing their total balance sheet to steadily decrease in the last year:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/ECBTotalAssetsNov2013.gif" alt="ECBTotalAssetsNov2013" title="ECBTotalAssetsNov2013.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

This has caused the Euro to appreciate. Here it is against the US dollar, with the top in the ECB&#8217;s balance sheet size circled in red on the chart:

And it is especially strong against the Yen, which is even more worrisome for the Europeans as the Japanese are much more direct competitors:

I had assumed that the Germans were going to be &#8211; German, and insist on keeping monetary policy relatively tight. I think it is now obvious that we have hit the point where they are more scared about deflation than they are worried about excessively easy monetary policy. 

They have hit the nuclear option of negative rates and I think we are about to enter into a whole new era. 

I have been long the Euro, and given today&#8217;s new development, it is time to give up on this trade. I am exiting it immediately.

I am also going to buy gold in Euro terms. If the Europeans are about to make real and nominal rates negative, then I have to own gold in that currency.

And finally, on a separate note, I have been keeping my eye on the Japanese Yen. In the last week, it broke out to new highs in the USDJPY rate (weaker Yen):

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/JPYNov2013.gif" alt="JPYNov2013" title="JPYNov2013.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

I am concerned that given the terrible Japanese trade deficit, the BoJ will not be able to allow the Yen to appreciate against the Euro, so they are going to also introduce new stimulus measures to weaken the Yen further. I am initiating a Yen short position.

We are entering into a new era of competitive devaluations. Just like Global Thermonuclear War, there will be no winners, but that won&#8217;t stop them from playing the game.
