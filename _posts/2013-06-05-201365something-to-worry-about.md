Overnight Japanese Prime Minister Abe made a speech that outlined the third prong of his plan to pull Japan out of their deflationary spiral downward.

The market was extremely disappointed and the Nikkei got clocked by 3.83%, closing at the low of the day and month.

This is an extremely worrying development as the market is becoming increasingly pessimistic about Japan&#8217;s bold new economic plan.

I have long held the theory that the dramatic moves in Japanese stocks and the Yen was too easy, too fast.  I felt that the hedge funds had put on these positions so aggressively that the Japanese authorities barely had to conduct any open market operations to achieve their goal.  I speculated that before this was all through, the Japanese authorities would be forced to deal with a market that tested their resolve.

I believe there is a chance that we are about to enter that period.  I am worried that all the macro tourists that have bought Japanese stocks as a way to play Abe-conomics are now dramatically offside and will be pulling the plug en mass.  I have been suspicious of the entire move up in Japanese stocks and I think we are about to see what is actually holding them at these lofty levels.

<span style="line-height: 1.6em">I am not advocating shorting anything.  But I do believe that it is a prudent time to pare down risk and to see what happens from here.  </span>

I am covering my short Yen position and trimming my bond shorts, but leaving my long gamma bond position.
