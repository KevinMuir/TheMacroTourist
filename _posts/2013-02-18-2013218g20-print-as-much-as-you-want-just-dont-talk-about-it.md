> &#8216;The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is: _You do not talk about Fight Club.&#8217; &#8211; Tyler Durden &#8211; Fight Club_

During the last couple of months it has felt as if the Japanese had forgotten the rules of the Foreign Exchange game.  Although excessive printing and competitive devaluations are allowed, what is not allowed is to say that out loud.  Remember Treasury Secretary John Snow&#8217;s &#8216;strong dollar policy&#8217; comments?  He would go on CNBC with a straight face and talk about the need for a strong US dollar, meanwhile the Administration and the Federal Reserve were actively doing everything in their power to achieve just the opposite.  The US competitive devaluation was tolerated largely because it was never explicitly stated.  Lately, the newly elected Japanese Prime Minister has broken the rules of the FX game by explicitly giving Yen devaluation targets.

To some extent I don&#8217;t blame him.  If the market will do your dirty work for you, why not just talk down the Yen?  It seems harmless enough.

However, what the Prime Minister has forgotten is that Japan is part of an increasingly global financial system.  The rest of the world is not so keen on the Yen&#8217;s devaluation, and most importantly, they are very worried about slipping into a trade/currency war.  By giving explicit targets for the Yen&#8217;s devaluation, the Japanese government is negating the ability of the Financial Officials to even pretend that the currencies are being set by free and open markets.

I had been expecting the Japanese to come under increasing pressure during this week-end&#8217;s G20 meeting.  Although this did indeed happen, the end result of the meeting was merely a reprimand for talking about it so openly without any real impediment to continuing the policy.

US Treasury Undersecretary Lael Brainard criticized the &#8216;loose talk about currencies,&#8217; but failed to give any signals that the US was uncomfortable about the Japanese reflation policy.

In essence, the G20 said to Japan &#8211; &#8216;you&#8217;re fine to reflate your economy aggressively, but for God&#8217;s sake &#8211; don&#8217;t talk about actual levels of devaluation!&#8217;

And I guess that makes a lot of sense.  Bernanke and other academics have been criticizing Japan for more than a decade that they have not been aggressive enough in reflation.  It would be extremely unfair to now criticize the Japanese as they finally embark on the plan that Western economists espoused for so long.

### What does this mean for the markets?

Some wise traders like Bruce Krastings believe this development is in essence the go ahead by the G20 for the Japanese to continue with their devaluation policy and that the Yen selling is going to accelerate now that the risks of retaliation from other countries is removed.  I do understand this argument and I am not going to dismiss it lightly.

However, I am not yet convinced that market participants will continue selling now that there are no more explicit levels being targeted.  I still believe that the trade is extremely lopsided with speculators and ripe for a disappointment.

But one thing that I am sure of is that this is another sign that Central Bankers are headed down the road of inflation.  We were once again faced with the choice between reflation or sound monetary policy, and again, the easy way was chosen.  The world&#8217;s finance officials were quick to condemn the explicit discussion of this policy, but let&#8217;s face it, the currency war is indeed occurring.  Just because Tyler Durden said that you shouldn&#8217;t talk about Fight Club did not mean there were no fights&#8230;

We continue to head down the road to inflation.  Although many have mistaken the landmarks as very similar to the same roads of the past few years, we are approaching a point where they will soon be no denying that we have taken a different path.

I have just noticed another comment today from Draghi regarding the G20 meeting:

> During a G-20 meeting in Moscow last week, “I urged all parties to very, very strong verbal discipline” because “the less we talk about it, the better it is,” Draghi told European lawmakers in Brussels today

Draghi seems to be trying the well honed male technique of trying to ignore a problem in the hopes that it might go away.  Well, all of us with girlfriends/wives (and sometimes one or two of each), know that this technique never, ever works&#8230;
