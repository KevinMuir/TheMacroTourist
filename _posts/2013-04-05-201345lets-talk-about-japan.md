Yesterday while I was stuck in traffic driving my kids to one of their lessons, I turned on the satellite radio and tuned it to CNBC. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t usually watch CNBC as I have found their screaming matches and&nbsp;opinionated&nbsp;sensationalism too much to bear. &nbsp;For real business news I would much rather watch Bloomberg and have professional people like Tom Keene or Kathleen Hayes interview their guests in a respectful intelligent manner. &nbsp;But hey, I also can&#8217;t stand reality TV or Facebook, so what do I know?

Back to Japan&#8230; &nbsp;Yesterday on CNBC all everyone could do was talk about Japan. &nbsp;It was shocking how much they focused on it. &nbsp;But what was even more shocking was everyone&#8217;s attitude. &nbsp;It was unanimously all happy talk. &nbsp;There was not a single person expressing concern about the consequences of the government&#8217;s policies. &nbsp;And in terms of market advice, it was all talk about how the Yen is going so much lower and how this was so great for the stock market. &nbsp;It was only a win win. &nbsp;Climb aboard was the only thing I heard out of my radio.

Let me take a moment to discuss the BoJ&#8217;s recent QE program announcement. &nbsp;Prior to the announcement I had held the belief that there was a lot of positive expectations and that the Japanese very well might disappoint. &nbsp;That was wrong. &nbsp;BoJ Governor Kuroda followed through with an absolute stunningly large QE program. &nbsp;At first I didn&#8217;t comprehend the true enormity of the program. &nbsp;That was until I read a research piece that converted the duration risked asset purchase size in relation to the US QE programs and I realized that the Japanese program was literally twice as big as all the US QE programs. &nbsp;With this program the Japanese have made William Shatner proud and are indeed going where no one has gone before.

Once this program is complete, there will be no one that can claim that this science experiment in monetarism didn&#8217;t work that the Japanese simply didn&#8217;t do enough (which is pretty well the excuse for the past 25 years of Japanese deflation). &nbsp;I am pretty sure that even Paul Krugman and Ben Bernanke were impressed with this move.

Back to my story about listening to CNBC. &nbsp;All that gushed out of my radio was superlatives about the awesome trade of getting long Japanese stocks and short Yen. &nbsp;There was no one that expressed any sort of worry that this might not work. &nbsp;The only concern seemed to be that it might have run a little too far too fast and you might want to wait a day or two before getting into the trade.

I am indeed impressed that the Japanese have been so aggressive in trying to beat the back of deflation, although I think they waited much too long to finally wake up. &nbsp;They are now so deeply indebted that they didn&#8217;t have any choice &#8211; without this intervention, their economy was about to collapse in on itself.

However, this is where I am going to differ from all of the uber bullish CNBC guests. &nbsp;This policy is highly dangerous and although very much needed, it is not quite the no brainer long that most portray it to be. &nbsp;

### What could possibly go wrong?

The fact that Bank of Japan has committed to doubling the size of their balance sheet in the next two years in an attempt to achieve 2% inflation at a time when the real JGB bond rates are sub 1% across pretty well the whole curve, all the while the Japanese government&#8217;s debt to GDP is a mind boggling 200%+ is fraught with risk. &nbsp;To just mindlessly climb aboard the long Japanese stock trade due to this aggressive monetary policy is naive. &nbsp;

First of all, if the Japanese are successful in their implicit goal of devaluing the Yen, you need to be sophisticated enough to hedge out any currency risk. &nbsp;Although you would think that CNBC viewers would be able to understand that fact, this is the same network that uses a hyperventilating Jim Cramer and 1970 Batman like graphics to increase viewership. &nbsp;Have a look at the S&P 500 ETF versus the EWJ Japanase stock index ETF that trades in US dollars:

You can see that even though Japanese stocks have dramatically outperformed US stocks, when you take into account the currency effect, they are basically even.

Here is the Nikkei index versus the S&P500 index in nominal terms:

So when CNBC guests advocate getting long Japanese stocks, they better hope their viewership understand how to hedge out the currency risk.

But you might say, who cares if the average Joe doesn&#8217;t understand how to hedge out the currency, I watch Fast Money and understand how to also short Japanese currency futures so that I win on both sides of the trade! &nbsp;And yes, you are correct &#8211; you are in fact quite the smart &#8220;Fast Money&#8221; trader. &nbsp;This trade has indeed been quite a winner. &nbsp;**_The fact that since the November 2012 low, the Nikkei is up 47%, the Yen is down 22%, and CNBC&#8217;s airwaves are filled with pundits recommending that you get into the trade should give you absolutely no concern._**

Although yesterday&#8217;s CNBC guests have zero worries that this bold Japanese policy might have some worrisome repercussions, a fellow whose opinion I tend to give a little more credence to had this to say:

> “What Japan is doing is actually quite dangerous because they’re doing it after 25 years of just simply accumulating deficits and not getting the economy going. &nbsp;If the yen starts to fall, which it has done, and people in Japan realize that it’s liable to continue and want to put their money abroad, then the fall may become like an avalanche.”

> “If what they’re doing gets something started, they may not be able to stop it,”&nbsp;

These words of caution were issued by none other than George Soros. &nbsp;

Which brings me to one of my big concerns. &nbsp;The Japanese are completely bankrupt. &nbsp;Some economists might argue that no country that is a currency issuer can be bankrupt and I would agree. &nbsp;However, their debt will never be repaid in real terms. &nbsp;It is simply too large. &nbsp;As market participants begin to understand this, there is a very real possibility that the Yen will be sold aggressively and the so far controlled devaluation will turn into a full fledged free fall. &nbsp;A lower currency is stock market friendly &#8211; a currency crisis is not. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t forget that the US dollar / German Mark problems were one of the triggers for the 1987 US crash. &nbsp;There will reach a point where a declining Japanese Yen will no longer be viewed as Nikkei friendly. &nbsp;

Another concern I have relates to Japanese interest rates. &nbsp;The absurdity of the Japanese 10 year bond yielding 55 basis points when the BoJ has indicated that they will do pretty well whatever it takes to achieve 200 basis points of inflation is mind boggling. &nbsp;I would understand the JGB yield if the market was skeptical that the BoJ could achieve its target. &nbsp;However, the Nikkei and the Yen rate both are signalling that the Japanese will be successful. &nbsp;Either the bonds are wrong or the Nikkei and Yen are wrong. &nbsp;One of these sets of prices is going to be&nbsp;spectacularly incorrect.&nbsp;

So let&#8217;s recap. &nbsp;We have a bold new monetary expansion plan that is sending the Yen down, stocks up and the price of JGBs up. &nbsp;So far there has been nothing but upside for the Japanese government as stocks have made Japanese people more wealthy, the Yen has made their goods more easy to sell and the JGB price yield has made their debt cheaper to fund. &nbsp;Wow &#8211; they must be economic geniuses.

Hold on. &nbsp;I just don&#8217;t buy it. &nbsp;Something is going to go wrong. &nbsp;Although I am not sure yet what it is, I know in my gut that something is going to make things not as easy as the market currently believes. &nbsp;There is no free lunch, yet it certainly appears that this law is being refuted by Japanese policies. &nbsp;

Maybe markets are not quite as efficient as many believe? &nbsp;Maybe cagey old buggers like Soros are on to something when they warn about the Japanese policies. &nbsp;Could it be that the CNBC guests that are so bullish might be wrong? &nbsp;Nah, no way. &nbsp;Those guys are pros. &nbsp;It is grumpy naysayers like Soros that are wrong.

Last night, even though the Japanese government had just promised to buy massive amounts of JGBs for the next two years, the JGB market, which had initially rallied a full point on the announcement, had a litte tiny mini-crash. &nbsp;In a quick move for no real reason, the bond futures sold off from 146.50 to 143.25. &nbsp;

The JGBs subsequently recovered as the BoJ must have stamped some blue tickets, but it just goes to underscore the danger in these markets.

The CNBC Fast Money pros and hedge fund managers who are all piling into the Japanese stock market might very well want to reflect about the fundamentals reasons for owning Japanese stocks. &nbsp;I am not one to shun climbing aboard a trade based on a broad macro thesis, but the fact that everyone on CNBC is long Nikkei futures makes even macro tourists like me extremely nervous.

So how am I trading it?

I still like short Nikkei, short JPY and short JGB. &nbsp;If anything, I like even just short Nikkei and short JGBs outright now with no currency hedge, however, I realize that this in very much like standing in front of one of those Japanese magnetic high speed trains.

As I sit here writing this on Friday afternoon, I am staring at the screen, watching the Nikkei futures that trade in Chicago. &nbsp;Even though the S&P is down 12 handles, the Nikkei futures are up 200 points from their lows, and are trading at a massive 350 point premium to where the Nikkei index went out last night in Tokyo. &nbsp;That means the US traders are expecting the Nikkei to open up 2.5% on Sunday night. &nbsp;Of course they are. Why wouldn&#8217;t you climb aboard? &nbsp;The CNBC traders have given you the all clear. &nbsp;What could possibly go wrong?
