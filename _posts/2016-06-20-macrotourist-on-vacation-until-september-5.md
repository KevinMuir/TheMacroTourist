That's it for the MacroTourist for a little bit.  I am headed to the cottage for the summer.  Although I will be following the markets, I am taking some time off from writing.  For those readers who have in the past been kind enough to send pieces of research that I might find interesting, please continue to do so as I would be grateful.  

**Regular updates will resume on the 5th of September.**  

Thanks for reading throughout the year.  Have a great summer!
