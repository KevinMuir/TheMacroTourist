<p class="p1">
  The other day I was talking to one of my hedge fund buddies and he commented that he expects rates to rise, but not by much. That got me thinking. Who does expect rates to go up by a lot? Although there are very few brave souls who are openly bullish on US Treasuries at these levels (Gary Shilling and David Rosenberg are the only two who spring to mind), at the same time, there are <em>just as few who are openly </em><strong><em>extremely</em></strong><em> bearish on them.</em>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I have a theory that has been permanently imprinted on my mind from the time I was 20 years old and read Jack Schwager’s Market Wizards for the first time. One of the traders that was interviewed stated that he had a friend who positioned himself by simply observing what market move would hurt the most traders the worst. This comment had a profound effect on me and to this day, I always try to imagine the sort of market move that would cause the maximum amount of pain. It seems that all too often, this move plays out.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  It is similar to the theory that if all the strategists are clustered around a forecast of a 10% increase for the stock market, the safest bet is that the return is not going to be anywhere near that level. Up 35% or down 25% is probably a much more probable outcome.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  So when everyone tells me that rates are going to rise, but not by that much, it makes me think; either they are going to be wrong and rates are going to go down, or, rates are going to rise by <strong>way more than anyone expects</strong>.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Given the global massive printing and the subdued inflation concerns, the bond market is far from being priced for unexpected surprises. I would argue just the opposite &#8211; it is priced for continued monetary perfection. With the 10 year yielding 1.83% and CPI ticking at around 1.90%, the real yield is still negative.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Why then does <em>no one expects rates to rise a lot?</em>   Why can’t they?  (don’t worry, I know the reasons, I understand the fundamentals of our balance sheet recession). However, my point is that the market is positioned with almost no one set up for a big rise in rates. This is the exact kind of environment that leads to <strong>big surprises</strong>.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  The near universality of the lack of potential big move in rates higher is actually quite shocking.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  At one point in 2010 Nassim Taleb made the following statement:
</p>

> Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of “The Black Swan,” said “every single human being” should bet U.S. Treasury bonds will decline, citing the policies of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and the Obama administration. **It’s “a no brainer” to sell short Treasuries,** Taleb, a principal at Universa Investments LP in Santa Monica, California, said at a conference in Moscow today. **“Every single human being should have that trade.”**

<p class="p1">
  Here is the chart of the bond market since that bold assertion:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Taleb made the Market Gods angry with that comment and they proceeded to make a complete fool of him. However, since then, there has developed a complete lack of concern about the possibility that Taleb might in fact be correct.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  I have no desire to anger the Gods by proclaiming that 2013 will be the year that Taleb is finally vindicated, but I will note that the very fact that <em>no one is even considering this possibility,</em> greatly increases its chances of actually happening.

I just found this Q&A with Goldman Sach&#8217;s head economist, Jan Hatzius that best sums up consensus:

<p class="p1">
  <strong>10.Will interest rates rise?</strong>
</p>

Not much. … At the longer end of the curve, we do expect a small increase in 10-year Treasury yields to 2.2% by the end of 2013.
