Sometimes I have trouble articulating the reasons for my trades.  Sometimes I am not really sure what has triggered my sudden desire to cover a trade, but I have learned throughout the years not to argue with my &#8216;spidey-sense&#8217;.

I am covering my short Yen in its entirety this morning.  The Yen has declined a long, long way, and it is a super popular trade with the hedgies.  The great trader Yogi Berra once said, &#8220;Nobody goes there anymore.  It&#8217;s too crowded.&#8221;  Well, in the case of the Yen, let me be one of the first to &#8220;not go there anymore&#8221;.
