I have been a big bull on the US economy.  To a large degree this has been the correct call as over the last year the US economy has outperformed pretty well all other major economies.

The reason that I have been so bullish is that for a long time the consensus was extremely pessimistic about America&#8217;s prospects.  Between the fiscal cliff and all the other US political shenanigans, investors were reluctant to invest in the US.

I took a different attitude.  I believed that Bernanke&#8217;s extremely accommodative monetary policies would trump all other concerns.  I was also swayed by the fact that since the 2008 credit crisis, America has benefited from a lower US dollar and a recapitalization of its banking sector.  Although far from perfect, the long run decisions made by the Americans since the credit crisis would result in much more growth than the other major economies.

However, I am concerned that consensus has now turned a little too bullish on America and the recovery story is too much front page news.  This morning I turned on Bloomberg TV and Abby Joseph Cohen from Goldman Sachs was being interviewed.  She was extremely bullish and all I heard from her were feel good ideas like &#8220;demand is improving in the domestic economy&#8221;, etc&#8230;  I don&#8217;t want to pick too much on Mrs. Cohen, but I have no doubt that the shrewd traders at her firm of Goldman Sachs regularly make money &#8216;fading&#8217; her predictions.  Her opinion is not the &#8216;inside baseball&#8217; story that the more sophisticated traders bandy about.  Rather her story is the one reserved for TV and the Goldman Sachs&#8217; retail clients.

So let me give you what I think is on the mind of the more sophisticated group of traders.

Although the US economy has indeed performed quite well during the last year, the last week has given rise to some concerns that it might be slowing down.  Whereas previously all the economic numbers were often stronger than the overly pessimistic economists were expecting, lately the economic releases have undershot the heightened expectations.

This is evident in the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index which measures economic results versus their expectations:

Although it had been trending higher since the start of the new year, last week it took a big dip lower.

This was the result of poor economic releases such as:

  * Consumer Confidence which came in at 59.7 instead of the 67.5 which was expected.
  * Pending Home sales at 5.0% versus 8.7%
  * GDP at 1.8% instead of 2.1%
  * Initial Claims at 357k versus 340k
  * Chicago Purchasing Managers Index at 52.4 versus 56.5

**There is no doubt that last week was worrying in that the trend of increasingly stronger US economic numbers which outperformed expectations was broken.**

The US bond market has rallied (lower yields) on this disappointment.

However we are now left with a big question that the more sophisticated traders are asking themselves &#8211; are these disappointments the sign of a new trend or simply a pause in the recovery?

This question is made all the more worrisome due to the fact that over the last few years, March/April has often marked a top in the stock market:

I don&#8217;t have an answer, nor even an opinion right now.  All I am sure of is that the sentiment is very bullish even though the economy seems to be stalling.

This time might indeed be different.  There is no doubt that regular $85 billion of POMO from the Federal Reserve is going to have an effect.  My gut tells me that this backstop will be more effective than most market participants realize.

However at the same time, I am not going to blindly listen to the Abby Joseph Cohen&#8217;s of the world who are seemingly continually bullish as long as stocks are rising.  The next couple of weeks will be extremely important in determining if this is a slight economic hiccup or the start of a more ominous slowdown.
