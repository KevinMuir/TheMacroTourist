This morning we had the release of the weekly jobless claims.  Over the last month the trend has been solidly lower, but this morning&#8217;s release was a big disappointment.  Economists were expecting 330k claims, but instead it came in at 360k.

I have highlighted the relationship of the stock market and the jobless claims before.  Here is an up to date chart of the S&P 500 versus the inverted jobless claims (less claims means it goes higher):

This is by no means a perfect relationship, but you will notice that the two series broadly track one another.

The problem is that weekly jobless claims are quite &#8216;noisy&#8217;.  You will notice that they seem to chop up and down, so you can run the risk of over interpreting one data point.

However, the stock market is quite extended, and it very well might be &#8216;looking&#8217; for an excuse to correct.

I am taking a stab at a short trade this morning.  I am going to run a tight stop and I will definitely be flat by tomorrow&#8217;s open as Liquid Ben Bernanke is scheduled to buy $5 billion of bonds tomorrow, and I know enough than to try to fade that dude.
