I was listening to Bloomberg radio this morning (I can&#8217;t stand the CNBC screaming matches or the belligerent hosts) and there was a trader from the CME that said something to the effect that &#8220;Bernanke&#8217;s failure to taper in September is going to go down as one of his biggest mistakes.&#8221;

The more I thought about this, the more I came to the conclusion that he very well might be right.

The situation reminded me of Greenspan&#8217;s big mistake during the DotCom bubble. Remember Greenspan&#8217;s Y2K liquidity panic?

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/NDX1999Nov1913.gif" alt="NDX1999Nov1913" title="NDX1999Nov1913.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

The bottom panel is the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet and the top panel is the Nasdaq index during this period. You can see that Greenspan flooded the system with so much liquidity that the Nasdaq went up approximately 92% from October of 1999 to March 2000. It turned out to be a colossal mistake that had Greenspan not managed to eclipse by making an even bigger bubble with the real estate debacle, would have been one of the greatest errors in the history of Central Banking. 

Although we are not rallying anywhere near as violently as 1999, this latest move higher is beginning to feel a little like Greenspan&#8217;s overshoot.

Since the no-taper caper we have seen market after market go parabolic to the upside. It was made all the worse by Yellen&#8217;s &#8220;the best way out of the need for QE is to do more QE&#8221; speech.

Everywhere you turn there are increasing signs of massive speculation. How about the bitcoin mania? Although I understand the benefits of the new currency, anything that starts going up 25% day after day has a lot more to do with speculation than the ushering in of a new monetary era. I know the bitcoiniacs will be mad at me for saying this, but I firmly believe that if the Fed was tapering and returning policy to a more normal level, bitcoin would be nothing more than a method for geeks to pay for their star trek memorabilia. 

Or how about Mark Zuckerberg offering $3 billion for SnapChat? I am not sure who I am more offended by; the 23 year old punks who turned him down or the 30 year old billionaire that can afford to peel off $3 billion for an app that does little more than allows teens to send naked pictures of themselves to others.

I don&#8217;t buy the argument that you need to be long because the Fed has made stocks the only game in town. This is a mugs game and although there will be a few Mark Cubans who actually sell at the top, on the whole, buying stocks based on irresponsible Fed policy is not going to work for everyone. Eventually either wealth needs to be created through real economic profits or you need to sell it to a greater fool. I have a hard time believing that real economic growth is coming at anywhere near the levels that the market is discounting and I am even more unsure about selling to another greater fool because I have to be the last fool out there with my short attempts. 

In September the Fed had done a really good job at preparing the markets for the taper. It was fairly well &#8220;baked in&#8221; and although it might have caused a hiccup or two, the markets would have been able to digest it.

By not tapering, and then with Yellen adding fuel to the fire, the Fed has managed to ignite every speculative fire they could find. Now the eventual tapering is going to introduce much more risk as the markets will be even more extended and out of sync with the economic fundamental value.

This speculative feeding frenzy is not creating economic growth, but merely encouraging more misallocation of resources. I think that fellow from the CME was onto to something. It is easy to play armchair Central Bank quarterback, but I must admit that having Benanke throw an interception so late in the game before he retires very well might never be forgotten.
