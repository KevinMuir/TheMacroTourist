Last night, to no one&#8217;s great surprise, the US government failed to reach an agreement and the shutdown of non-essential services commenced. The markets gave it a big collective yawn and resumed their bullish ways. The S&P was actually up 8 points when I woke up early this morning.

I am not expecting a big dramatic swoon on last night&#8217;s developments, but I will stick by my call that the markets are too sanguine about this development. I do not believe that there will be a quick solution, and that this will most likely drag through October until they push up against the debt ceiling deadline. At that point, I do believe the markets will be much more concerned about the politicians inability to play nice together.

We are on a collision course for an epic showdown in Washington. The markets are assuming that the politicians will veer away at the last minute, but I am assigning a much greater possibility that the game of chicken results with a massive traffic accident.

The fact that the markets are so easily shrugging off the government shutdown will only embolden the obstinate politicians with driving even closer to the brink. The Tea Party will be able to point to the market&#8217;s reaction and even argue that it is _good for the economy._

Right now the market does not care one iota about the problems in Washington. However I have seen this sort of reaction before. Often the bad news keeps piling up with no reaction, until finally we hit the point where the bad news becomes **too much too handle** and then in one fell swoop, the market quickly prices in a bad outcome. I suspect that is what is going to happen hereâ€¦
