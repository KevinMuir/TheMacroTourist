The media loves to call Fairfax&#8217;s Prem Watsa the &#8220;Canadian Warren Buffett.&#8221;

However, after Prem&#8217;s latest stunt with Blackberry, all I can do is paraphrase Senator Bentson with the following;
  
**
  


> &#8220;I have never worked for Warren Buffett. I have never known Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett is no friend of mine. But Prem &#8211; I can definitely attest &#8211; you are no Warren Buffett.&#8221; </p>

Warren Buffett would never have made the Letter of Intent offer without being confident that he was going to be able to follow through. 

I am not confused at why Prem&#8217;s bid failed (Blackberry is a complete shit show &#8211; and that is probably being nice), but I am still perplexed as to why Prem made the bid in the first place. This is a tremendous hit to his reputation and there seems to be absolutely no upside for him.

Once he made the bid, I gave Prem the benefit of the doubt and assumed he knew more than the market. I now know that was completely wrong.

Anecdotal reports were that when the market started to doubt Prem&#8217;s willingness to follow through on the deal that he was hurt. Usually one who eschews the media, Prem reached out to several papers to offer reassurance that he was good for the deal. This only further led me to believe that Prem knew more than the market.

When Blackstone&#8217;s Schwartzman used the MAC clause to weasel out of the United Rental Deal in 2008, I was not surprised. Blackstone is a different animal and you should always expect that this sort of behaviour is a possibility. However, I really didn&#8217;t expect it from Prem&#8217;s Fairfax.

I can only think that either Prem should be now taken out of the Berkshire bucket and tossed in the Blackstone bucket, or that Prem isn&#8217;t thinking straight. Either way, it is extremely disappointing.

Either that or his wife is using their skins to make a purse. ]
