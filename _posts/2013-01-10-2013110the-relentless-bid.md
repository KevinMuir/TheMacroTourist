This market increasingly reminds me of 2009.  During that time, it seemed like everyone was bearish and every dip was thought to be the start of the inevitable resumption lower.  Yet, most morning sell offs quickly bottomed and were met with a relentless bid for the rest of the day that closed the market at the highs of the day.

Back then it took me awhile to figure out that the Fed’s POMO operation were having a big affect on the stock market’s day to day performance.

Today I am not as slow on the uptake and [I have been intently studying the Fed’s daily operation schedule](https://gfbcompanies.squarespace.com/the-macro-tourist/2012/12/7/pomo-effect-revisited.html) to watch for days to push my bets on the long side.  You can find the schedule [here](http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/tot_operation_schedule.html).

It is my observation that you want to increase your exposure on any day where the Fed buys $3 or more billion.

The twitter stream and CNBC might be filled with incessant chatter about the ‘stupidity’ of this rally.  My advice &#8211; let them chatter.  Our job is not to figure out ‘what should be’, but ‘what is’.
