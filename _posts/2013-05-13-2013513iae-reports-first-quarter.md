This morning Ithaca Energy reported their first quarter results.  Their production figures were in the upper range of 2013 guidance.  As usual, these guys are quietly going about their business of building a great oil company.

The stock has been suffering over the last couple of months due to the great &#8216;commodity unwind&#8217;, but today&#8217;s results have managed to reverse the general malaise that has caused the stock to continually drift lower.

So far this morning in London trading the stock is shooting higher:

I continue to love this stock and today&#8217;s results only reinforce my belief that this stock is a great opportunity.
