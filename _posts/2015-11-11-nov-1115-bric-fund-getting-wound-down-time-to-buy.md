Almost fifteen years ago, Goldman Sach&#8217;s Jim O&#8217;Neil coined the term &#8220;BRIC&#8221; to describe the up and coming economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China. I doubt Jim had any clue how popular the term would ultimately become&#8230;

And with that popularity came the trendy specialized funds. But like all fame, it eventually fades. Especially when performance lags.

With that terrible underperformance, investors have fled the Goldman Sachs&#8217; BRIC fund more quickly than Charlie Sheen at a court mandated AA meeting.

Over the week-end Goldman Sachs decided enough was enough, and decided to wind the BRIC fund down.

When the originator of the term is giving up on the BRICs, I think it is worth taking a shot. MSCI is keeping their BRIC ETF going (ticker BKF), and yesterday I took a punt on the long side. Call me foolish for trying to catch this knife, but I bet I am not alone. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me at all if some traders from the squid are doing the exact same thing&#8230;

Thanks for reading,
