Over the week-end it was announced that Ithaca Energy (IAE) was being added to the TSX index.

This has been one of my few good trades lately, and at the risk of being too cute, I am going to lighten up into this pop. This has been my biggest individual stock holding and it is time to ring the register on a third of the position. (for those of you that worry that I am going to anger the Market Gods by talking about my winners, rest assured, I have missed many a trade lately and that I have plenty of losers to make up for this lonesome winner).

I think any rally might be exaggerated by the fact that given IAE&#8217;s recent rise, many long positions will be showing significant profits and the holders might not be interested in making sales (thus triggering tax gains) this close to year end. 

The indexers will need to buy more than 10 million shares, and I plan to help them out by selling them some of my position.

I am not sure yet on my timing, it is going into the index at Friday&#8217;s closing price, but I will make some sales before that point as often times index additions make their highs before the actual add date.

Sometime over the next week I am going to peel a third of my position off.
