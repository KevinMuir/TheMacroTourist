Over the last few months we have seen the &#8216;commodity trade&#8217; come off with a vengeance.  In almost a blink of an eye, the market completely abandoned its love affair with commodities.

Gold got pummelled:

Copper fared no better:

Even iron ore had a terrible few months:

The majority of this carnage was the result of the the market&#8217;s awakening to the fact that China was not going to continue its massive infrastructure build out for eternity.  The China skeptics who warned that the spending could not continue indefinitely were finally proven correct as the Chinese government embarked on a goal of rebalancing their economy towards a more consumption led model.

It is still up in the air as to whether or not the infrastructure build out of the last 5 years will prove as wasteful as the China bears believe, but there can be no doubt that the Chinese economy is slowing, and more importantly, changing.

The Chinese economic releases during this last quarter have been dramatically below expectations, which can be seen through the plunging Chinese economic surprises index which measures releases versus expectations:

The market has been caught off guard as up until the last few months, most institutional investors were fully aboard the &#8216;China will grow forever&#8217; ship.  As this ship has started to take water, these investors have scampered like rats, and in the case of the hedge funds, have even started to be poring buckets of water on the sinking ship to help it go under.

When you combine China&#8217;s slowing / rebalancing with the US government&#8217;s decision to cut back on spending due the budget impasse, it is quite obvious as to why the gloabl economy has hit a little hiccup.

This global slow down is also obvious in the G10 Economic Surprise index:

At this point you are probably saying to yourself, &#8220;that&#8217;s a great explanation of the reason commodities and the economy have declined, but that is about as exciting as my grandmother claiming she was once quite a dish.  It may be true, but it doesn&#8217;t do anything for you.&#8221;

Yes, you are correct, so far everything has been analysis of the past.  How does that help us with our forecasting of where we go from here?

To understand that, we need to think about what the consequences of this slow down has been.

There can be no doubt that the US budget problems have forced the Federal Reserve to be extra accommodative.  This has meant that we have probably had more QE than had the budget impasse and China slowdown not occurred.

Although we can argue forever whether QE is successful in the long run for stimulating the economy, there can be no doubt that it has forced US risky assets higher.

This extra accommodative US monetary policy has also coincided with the introduction of the Japanese &#8216;QE on steroids&#8217; policy.  Between these two major Central Banks, we have had 3 months of unprecedented monetary stimulus.  Although the world&#8217;s economy has yet to respond to this stimulus, asset markets have exploded higher with the US S&P 500 hitting all time highs and the Nikkei up over 75% during this period.

This period of massive monetary stimulus has paradoxically also occurred while commodity markets were in free fall.  It has left many hard money advocates scratching their heads and maybe even wondering if you can create wealth without inflation by simply printing money.

When you combine the massive monetary stimulus in the US and Japan, which has resulted in money chasing risky assets, along with the massive unwinding of the &#8216;commodities&#8217; trade, you have had the perfect recipe for Canadian and other &#8216;commodity countries&#8217; stocks to massively under perform.

Have a look at the chart of the S&P 500 relative to the TSX60 over the last year:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/SPX%20vs%20TSX%20May%2030%2013.gif" />

The S&P 500 has exploded higher versus the TSX60.

We are hitting levels that we last saw in during the dark days of 2008 when it looked like the global economy was going collapse:

Although I acknowledge that monetary policy is becoming less and less effective, Central Banks are using more and more stimulus.  Although I think the long terms costs of these extremely accommodative policies will end up being very high, I continue to believe that monetary policy is not as ineffective as the market believes.  In fact, I think the most likely scenario is that the policy is too effective and causes too much inflation.

However, monetary policy acts with a lag.  Therefore, while the bears continue to bemoan the economy&#8217;s lack of follow through, I contend that they are simply not being patient enough.

I am bullish on global growth and a great way to play it is to buy Canadian stocks and sell US and European stocks against it.

I know that seems contrary to my belief that China will end up being a house of cards, but I think that this &#8216;growth is dead&#8217; move is way over done.  I think the surprise over the next few quarters will be how quickly growth resumes.

Capital has been scared out of commodity countries and has chased risky assets in other countries much too high relative to the &#8216;real asset&#8217; countries.  I am willing to bet that this move is nearing the end.
