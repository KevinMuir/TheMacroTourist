The avalanche of liquidity fuelled buying continues this morning regardless of anything and everything else.

It is truly astonishing and a little scary.  The fundamentals don&#8217;t seem to matter at all.  The money is simply being pushed into the market, and much to the relief of both Kuroda and Bernanke, it is flowing directly into financial assets.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/Bernanke%20Apr%2011%2013.jpg" /><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/5166c9dee4b07ccd0c1e4123/1365690847654/300px-Hiroki_Kuroda_(2010).jpg" />

Yesterday I showed some charts about how stock prices were heading straight up at a time when most fundamental indicators were actually rolling over.  This is the direct result of Japan&#8217;s liquidity injection.

However, it is not limited to stocks only.  Entire countries are suffering from massive inflows that are not reflecting the fundamentals.

Yesterday Australia announced their unemployment numbers.  They were terrible.  Economists were expecting a net loss of 7.5K jobs and an unemployment rate of 5.4%.  Instead they got a loss of 36.1K jobs and a rate of 5.6%.  Given the Australian dollar&#8217;s strength of late, you would expect this news to cause an AUD sell off.  Well, we got one and it lasted about 2 hours before the Japanese liquidity rushed in to buy the high yielding AUD assets:

So here we have a country whose economic fortunes are headed lower, yet the currency rallied on the news.  Now sometimes this makes sense.  Sometimes the market has anticipated much worse news and it is &#8216;fully baked in.&#8217;  However, look at the recent price of the AUD dollar.  It has not &#8216;baked in&#8217; any bad news at all, and in fact, over the last month looks to be discounting an increase in Australian economic activity:

These aren&#8217;t efficient markets operating freely to set prices.  This is a massive distortion caused by the Japanese monetary policy.

So far it continues to manifest itself with higher stock prices, but I am concerned about the logic of buying stocks at these prices.

And it is not just me that is worried.  Yesterday on CNBC, the all time greatest real estate investor Sam Zell (who plugged Blackstone with his entire real estate company at the very top), had this to say:

  * &#8220;What we are seeing here is like a **giant tsunami of liquidity**.&#8221;
  * &#8220;**People look at the market and think things are better**. The level of uncertainty has reached a point where people are just throwing money [at risky assets] because they don&#8217;t know what else to do with it.&#8221;
  * &#8220;I **would not be adding money to the stock market. This is a very treacherous market**.&#8221;
  * **The current stock market feels like the housing market of 2006**. Everybody can&#8217;t afford to miss it.&#8221;
  * &#8220;We are **suffering through another irrational exuberance**.&#8221;

We have hit that point where price action is completely divorced from fundamentals.  I have mistakenly been fighting it with short European stocks and other trades that I feel are crappy assets that have rallied too far, but I am getting run over by Kuroda and Bernanke.

The market does not care one whit about any sort of analysis about the long term logic of these positions.  There is money to be put to work, and that is all that matters.

I am still surprised that the Central Bankers have managed to keep the inflation limited to financial assets.  I guess I was wrong when I said things weren&#8217;t that easy.  They have showed me that they really are.

My hat is off to them for being able to so deftly navigate this monetary madness.
