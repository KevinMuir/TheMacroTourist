In early August [In early August](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2013/8/6/double-knife-catching) fading the stock euphoria and hedge it by taking the other side of the AUDJPY pessimism. Â At that time, I was a little worried about losing some fingers as the S&P seemed unstoppable and the AUDJPY was mired in a deep bear market.

At the time of the trade, the S&P 500 was trading at 1694 and the AUDJPY 87.50.

Since then, the S&P has declined to 1639 and the AUDJPY has rallied to 91.10.

Although I think this trade can continue to work, prudence is the better part of valour, and I am taking off a third of the position at a decent profit.
