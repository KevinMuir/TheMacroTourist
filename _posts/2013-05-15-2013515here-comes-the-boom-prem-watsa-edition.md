As you are no doubt aware, I am a big Prem Watsa fan.  It is not that I think he never gets anything wrong (he is probably too bearish right now for example), but on the whole, I wouldn&#8217;t want to write too many tickets on the other side of his trades.

Recently Chorus Aviation has been having some troubles.  Dividend cut, ongoing labour dispute, etc, etc&#8230;  A pretty ugly situation.  As I dialled the chart, it suddenly jogged my memory that it was only a few months ago that Prem sold his entire chunk at $4.50.

I felt like I had to document the trade because Prem sure nailed another one&#8230;

Remember, don&#8217;t make it a habit to be on the other side of Pem&#8217;s trades for anything more than a nanosecond&#8230;
