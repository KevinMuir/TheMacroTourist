Yesterday the recent pattern of the stock market rallying in the morning, pausing at lunch and then closing at the highs was broken. We did get our usual 930am to 11am ramp higher, but this time, the rally failed to hold.<figure id="attachment_14871" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-14871" alt="SPXGIPFeb2014.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/SPXGIPFeb2014.png" width="600" height="382" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/SPXGIPFeb2014-300x191.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/SPXGIPFeb2014.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/SPXGIPFeb2014.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Intraday S&P 500 chart</figcaption></figure> 

The first hit came at lunch time when the Fed&#8217;s Williams gave a speech that made it clear that absent a dramatic change in the economic situation, the Fed was going to continue with its schedule of winding down the QE3 program. I have been stressing that the Fed is going to stay on the taper schedule until something breaks. The market _wants the Fed to be more willing to entertain the idea of slowing down or stopping the taper,_ but that is simply the market&#8217;s collective desire as opposed to an actual analysis of the situation.

We are in an unique situation where the market is ignoring what the Fed is indicating. Market participants don&#8217;t believe them. Therefore as Fed officials stick to the script and continue to make speeches that show that the taper is the default policy, bit by bit the stock market is forced to reprice to this reality. This is why even though San Francisco&#8217;s Federal Reserve President John Williams comments were **nothing new,** the stock market still sold off.

As this realization is increasingly priced in, the stock market should at the margin be under pressure.

Don&#8217;t get fooled by those who claim that the Fed is going to slow down the taper. They are on a set course and absent an economic collapse or a financial crisis, they will stick to the schedule of reducing the QE program by $10 billion every meeting.   **The Fed will continue with the taper until something breaks.**

The market was already reeling  from William&#8217;s comments when the next hit came.  I have long believed that although the Fed was almost certain to continue with the taper, I thought they were going to attempt to replace the monetary stimulus from the QE programs with extremely easy forward guidance.

However yesterday&#8217;s Fed minutes revealed a Fed that was much more hawkish than most market participants anticipated. As the minutes from the Fed&#8217;s previous meeting was digested, the selling in the stock market intensified and we closed on the lows.

What was surprising was that the minutes noted that a &#8220;few participants&#8221; raised the possibility that an initial increase in short term rates should come &#8220;relatively soon.&#8221; This is very aggressive language. It is well known that there are a few hawks that want QE wound down quickly, but their aggressiveness regarding raising the short term interest rate is not expected.

Don&#8217;t misunderstand me, I don&#8217;t think they are going to raise rates anytime soon. I suspect that something is going to break before the Fed finishes winding down their QE3 program, but even the whiff of a hint of higher short term rates is going to spook the market.

When the Fed had initially started the tapering, the market sold off the front end of the curve in anticipation of an eventual tightening. The Fed then went to work stressing to the market that &#8220;tapering was not tightening.&#8221; Along with the help of some soft macro data, the Fed was able to talk the front end back down.

Here is the chart of the yield of the US 2 Year Treasury:<figure id="attachment_14881" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-14881" alt="USGG2YrFeb2014.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/USGG2YrFeb2014.png" width="600" height="340" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/USGG2YrFeb2014-300x170.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/USGG2YrFeb2014.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/USGG2YrFeb2014.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">US 2 Year Treasury Yield</figcaption></figure> 

During the past couple of months the yield has dropped from almost 45 basis points down to 31 basis points.

However this bond market is not priced for a Fed that is thinking about raising short term rates &#8220;relatively soon&#8221;. Not only is the market not ready for a tightening, the vast majority of participants are still skeptical of the Fed continuing on their taper schedule.

The extremely easy policies of the last 5 years have created a perception that the Fed&#8217;s largesse will continue indefinitely.

**We are currently in a unique period where the market is not accurately discounting the future Fed policy.** Like a star crossed lover who doesn&#8217;t believe their partner when they are told their relationship is over, the market is continuing to assume that the good times will continue forever. One of these days the market is going to go to the bar and see their former lover flirting with someone else and then the reality will set in.

Given that the market is offering a very attractive risk reward pricing environment, it is time to increase some bets. If I am wrong and the Fed does blink sooner than I anticipated, it will hurt, but given that market is already hoping for this outcome, the loss won&#8217;t be nearly as much as if I am correct and the Fed ends up being tighter than participants are hoping.

Therefore yesterday I made some shifts in my book.

First of all, I added to my Euro short. I am offside on my initial position, but I feel much better entering this trade on some recent strength as opposed to selling into a hole:<figure id="attachment_14891" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-14891" alt="EURFeb2014.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/EURFeb2014.png" width="600" height="342" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EURFeb2014-300x171.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EURFeb2014.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/EURFeb2014.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">EUR &#8211; at least I am selling some strength this time</figcaption></figure> 

Secondly, I covered my entire position of long GDX ETF (short DUST). If I am correct and the Fed is tighter than participants believe, then gold might suffer. I am selling my gold stocks, but keeping my actual precious metal positions. Although I am a big precious metal bull, I am weary of the miners. They are still suffering from the terrible balance sheets created in the overly optimistic period of the final innings of the bull move higher. It will take some time still until they are righted. I would rather own the metal than the miners. And if I am correct about the stock market being under pressure, they might under perform the actual metal by virtue of being an equity. I have had a good run with this position, but it is time to ring the register and drive on. I will remain a precious metal bull, but will let others play the mining stocks.

And finally, I have shorted some US 2 Year Treasury futures. The 2 year is trading at just a shade over 30 basis points. This has proved to be the bottom end of the range in the past, and I think the risk reward favours a short position. If I am wrong, it hopefully goes to 25 to 27 basis points. But if I am correct, then we could easily have a move back up to 50 basis points in a blink of an eye. It just seems too compelling to not put on.

Given that I am already short equities, I am pushing a little on this trade. If the Fed dramatically alters course it will hurt. But I think that this is a very compelling opportunity and I am willing to take that chance.

**Positions**

**UPDATE New Position:  Short US 2 Year Treasury Futures.  **I think the downside is a move from 31 bps to 25 while the upside is a move up to 50 bps.  Conviction 4

**UPDATE: Short Euro.  **Added to this trade into the recent rally.   Conviction 5

**UPDATE: Cover entire Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).  **Time to ring the register.  Still long actual precious metals.

**Short Nasdaq 100 futures, short Eurostoxx futures, and short Nikkei futures.  **I entered the trade last Wednesday with idea that the Fed is going to taper until something breaks and that the bulls are pushing their luck.  Although I was looking like I might be correct for about 5 minutes, the mighty bull beast has re-emerged and is testing my resolve.  For now, I hang tight.  Conviction 4.  No stops for now

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index vs Long S&P 500.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities.   Conviction 5

<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Short Yen. </strong></strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> Establish short Yen last week.  Now I will sit tight and wait.  Conviction 4</span>

**Short JGB futures.  **I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.</strong> <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.</span>

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
