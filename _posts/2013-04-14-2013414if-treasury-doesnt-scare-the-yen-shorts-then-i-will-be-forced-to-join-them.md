This week-end, the newly appointed US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew released the Treasury&#8217;s bi-yearly &#8220;Report to Congress on International
  
Economic and Exchange Rate Policies.&#8221; &nbsp;Usually traders are centered on whether the US will be brave enough to escalate the rhetoric against China and actually refer to them as a &#8216;currency manipulator&#8217;, or just continue with their usual &#8216;we wish they wouldn&#8217;t do that&#8217; language. &nbsp;

However this report laid a huge turd down in the path of the attempted Japanese economic reflation:

> &#8220;We will continue to press Japan to adhere to the commitments agreed to in the G7 and G 20, to remain oriented towards meeting respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments and to refrain from competitive devaluation and targeting its exchange rate for competitive purposes.&#8221;

Boom! &nbsp;Out the blue, the US does not seem to be endorsing the aggressive Japanese policy quite as strongly as market participants had hoped.

The report was released on Friday, after all the markets had basically closed, but in the limited early Sunday trading, the Yen has so far rallied a full percent &#8211; trading at 98 after a 99 USDJPY close.

As I read through my research, this week-end&#8217;s consensus analysis very much came to the conclusion that although this was a short term set back that would cause the Yen to rally, nothing could derail the declining trend and that any move would be quickly retraced.

I am still mulling over the consequences of this move. &nbsp;

  * I am perplexed if it was a real signal to the Japanese, or whether it was something to merely appease political concerns with other nations. &nbsp;
  * Could it be that although Bernanke & Co. is on board at the Federal Reserve, the US administration does not approve? &nbsp;That makes sense because at the end of the day, it is a lot easier to sell Toyotas at 110 or 125 USDJPY than at 80 USDJPY.
  * If it was a real signal, does it mean anything? &nbsp;What could the US do anyway? &nbsp;They have basically allowed China to engage in manipulative monetary policy for decades and not even had the guts to call them out on it. &nbsp;
  * And if it was a real signal, what are the Japanese going to do? &nbsp;Do they back off because of the political ramifications, or do they simply plough ahead oblivious to the consequences.

These are some tough questions, and I don&#8217;t have a ton of answers right now.

However, I do have some opinions on the trading of this situation.

Last week, I was lucky enough to buy some Yen calls which all of a sudden are well on side this evening. &nbsp;

**If for some reason, the Yen makes it back to unchanged, then not only will I be forced to abandon these calls, I will have to go back to my core short Yen position.**

At the end of the day, I am extremely bearish on the Yen. &nbsp;I had bought some calls because I thought the boat was extremely crowded with speculators. &nbsp;If this news is not enough to shake them off, then probably nothing will. &nbsp;This was exactly the sort of event I was anticipating, and if the market does not react bullishly, then it is a bear market that I must be a part of.</p> </p></p>
