It seems that Congress finally got the message that constant childish bickering and taking the economy to the brink of default is not really why they were sent to Washington. 

In a refreshing surprise, it was just announced that they have reached a bi-partisan budget deal:

> Congressional negotiators reached a modest budget agreement Tuesday to restore about $65 billion in automatic spending cuts from programs ranging from parks to the Pentagon, with votes expected in both houses by week&#8217;s end.
> 
> Officials said the increases would be offset by a variety of spending reductions and increased fees elsewhere in the budget totaling about $85 billion over a decade, enough for a largely symbolic cut of roughly $20 billion in the nation&#8217;s $17 trillion debt. 

Congress is never a particularly loved group, but the last few years of especially acrimonious battles has left the public with an all time low approval rating of Congress:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/12/CongressDec1013.png" alt="CongressDec1013" title="CongressDec1013.png" border="0" width="600" height="289" />

It seems that a 9% approval rating is as low as these geniuses were willing to go, and they have finally decided to work together to pass a budget and avoid another repeat of the last debacle that took the US country to the edge of default.

I don&#8217;t think this will affect the market in the short term, except to help take some pressure off the Fed. Don&#8217;t forget that one of the reasons the Fed passed on tapering in September was that they were concerned about fiscal drags from Washington budget battles. 

The Tea Party members are already hollering about the lack of fiscal discipline:

> Officials said that under the agreement, an estimated $65 billion in automatic spending cuts would be restored through the end of the next budget year, which runs to Sept. 30, 2015.
> 
> Officials who described the details in advance of the news conference did so on the condition of anonymity, saying they were not authorized to speak on the record.
> 
> The same was not true of conservative organizations, which attacked the proposal as a betrayal of a hard-won 2011 agreement that reduced government spending and is counted as among the main accomplishments of tea party-aligned Republicans who came to power earlier the same year in the House.

The budget deal should not be considered a fiscal stimulus plan, but it does help reduce the fiscal drag from the sequestration. 

This will be another slight tail wind at the economy&#8217;s back. 

And it will add more ammunition to the &#8220;Fed tapering in December&#8221; crowd&#8217;s arguments.

I continue to stick to my thesis that the market will spend the next week pricing in an increased likelihood of a Fed December tapering and therefore you should be leaning short. I am looking for a _sell the rumour buy the news_ reaction from the equity market.

I also think this budget deal helps solidify the budding economic recovery. I believe that the economy will continue to improve and that the surprises will be on the upside. Just don&#8217;t confuse an improving economy with a rising stock market. They don&#8217;t need to go together. They very well might, but I still think the better trade is to be short fixed income rather than long equities.
