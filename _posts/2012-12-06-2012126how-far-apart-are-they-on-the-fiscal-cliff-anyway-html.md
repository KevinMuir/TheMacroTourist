    The markets are waiting on tenter hooks for the outcome of the fiscal cliff negotiations. Every time a politician steps up to the microphone to comment on the status of the negotiations, the markets snap violently in one direction or another.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Given the markets reactions, it is important to understand what they are really fighting about. So let&#8217;s do a little digging and figure out how much difference there is in the two parties&#8217; plans to solve the fiscal cliff.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I found a great web applet on the Washington Post website that shows the tax outcomes for five different families. Below is an example of what it would mean for a married couple with one child in college given the different potential outcomes:

  </p>
  
  <p>
    You will notice that for this family earning $38,746 their taxes are scheduled to increase by $718 under the Democrat plan, $2,035 under the Republican&#8217;s plan and $2,706 if we go over the cliff.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For me, the really surprising thing was how much their taxes were going to go up under any scenario! Under the Dems it will be 1.85% reduction in take home pay, for the <span class="caps">GOP </span>plan it will be 5.25% and with no plan, almost 7%! These are big numbers that are going to be a massive drag on the US economy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For the family earning $84,044, the different increases would be 1.85% (D), 2.5% (GOP) and 3.56% (FC).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For the family earning $137,593 it is 1.85% (D), 2.93% (GOP) and 5.85% (FC).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For the family earning $413,759 it is 1.6% (D), 1.46% (GOP) and 3.87% (FC).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And finally, for the family earning $941,510 it is 3.94% (D), 1.8% (GOP) and 5.25% (FC).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What was really shocking to me was how far apart these two sides really are. In the upper brackets, the <span class="caps">GOP </span>seem to be demanding an increase of less than 2% while the Dems are wanting 4%. At the low end, the <span class="caps">GOP </span>want to stick the little guy with an increase of over 5% and the Dems want to limit it to less than 2%.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To my mind it is pretty clear who I think is being unreasonable, but that is really beside the point. What is important is how far they are apart. And until I did the numbers, I didn&#8217;t realize how big that chasm actually was.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That is not to say that both sides can&#8217;t find some middle ground, but there are some pretty fundamental and large difference in the plan.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As I completed this exercise, the next thing that really surprised me was <strong><em>how much taxes were going to to go up under either plan.</em></strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is a big, big tax hike. I knew that if nothing was done that the tax hike would have been the largest in US history. But I did not realize that even the Democrat plan had such large increases for all Americans (including the lower classes).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I don&#8217;t want to bother talking about the moral issues about any of these plans, but I do want to highlight that this is <strong>going to be a massive drag on the economy.</strong> The world is experiencing a debt de-leveraging that is larger than we have ever witnessed. Increasing taxes into this de-leveraging is not going to help the economy one bit.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I used to think that a fiscal cliff deal would finally lift the cloud that is over hanging the economy. However, I am no longer so sure. The contractionary nature of the tax increases might offset any uncertainty removal economic bump.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    During the Great Depression Hoover passed the Revenue Act of 1932 which was the largest peacetime tax increase in history. Although many debate why the Great Depression lasted for as long as it did, most agree that this contributed to the malaise. I find it unbelievably ironic that the US might be about to repeat the very same mistakeâ€¦
