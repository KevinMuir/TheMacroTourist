Since the Fed&#8217;s QE4 announcement the stock market has basically been a one way ticket lower.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/50cb723be4b0b36b96e6161b/1355510332318/SPX%20Intra%20Dec%2014%2012-1.jpg" />

The market has become convinced that the Fed is pushing on a string and that monetary policy has become useless.  As I read through my trading blogs and other macro research pieces, I am shocked at the universality of the disdain for the Fed&#8217;s new QE programs.

The conventional wisdom seems to be that the policy is either going to be ineffective, or could actually accelerate the de-leveraging process.

I find it amusing how it was only two months ago that these same people were all advocating loading up on stocks in anticipation of QE3, yet here we are, with the Fed being even more aggressive than the previous program, but the cries are now to sell the market because the Fed cannot possibly affect stocks or the economy.

[In my previous post](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2012/12/12/y4q7x2t8ql1100u11dlqs6f358iglb) I outlined why the pundits who think the Fed has been too aggressive in their monetary easing are actually incorrect as over the last year, the Fed has basically not expanded their balance sheet.  Here is a picture of the Fed&#8217;s total assets since 2008 (notice how it basically sideways since 2011):

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/FARBAST%20Dec%2014%2012.gif" />

However that is about to change.  The Fed&#8217;s total balance is a little under $3 trillion.  With the introduction of QE3 and QE4, this will increase by $85 billion a month.  That means that next year at Christmas time the Fed will have increased its balance sheet from $3 trillion to $4 trillion.

**This will represent an increase of 33% in a year&#8217;s time!**

it will be almost as much was pushed into the system during the 2008 emergency programs.

I will acknowledge that the market seems to be very disappointed with the announcement.  There seems to be a lot of naysayers and the pessimism is very thick.

However, I don&#8217;t think you should over think this.

The Fed has become, in the words of the famed investor Paul MacCauley (formerly of PIMCO fame&#8230; back when they actually used to make a few right calls), &#8220;responsibly irresponsible&#8221;.  I don&#8217;t want to discuss too much whether this is the _right thing to do,_ but I would rather simply acknowledge that this is what _is being done_, so you might as well adapt.

The Fed has gone full on Colonel Kurtz.  There is no sense reasoning about it.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/50cb78cae4b0a7200ddf1efa/1355512011588/004dcf78-a3eb-4d11-90d7-6114b58371d0-cs_apocalypsenow.jpg" />

And make no mistake, this policy is extremely aggressive.  Inflation expectations are already elevated.  Have a look at this chart of the Fed&#8217;s favourite inflation barometer &#8211; the 5 year 5 year forward break even rate:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/5Y5F%20Break%20Even%20Dec%2014%2012.gif" />

You will notice that the inflation expectations are bumping up against the highest level seen over the last 5 years.  The last time the Fed engaged in a Quantitative Easing program this large was 2008, but back then this indicator was at 50 basis points.  It is now almost 300 basis points, which is above the Fed&#8217;s inflation target.

While we are on the topic of inflation targets, the fact that the Fed changed their acceptable inflationary band at Wednesday&#8217;s FOMC meeting seems to be getting very little discussion.  However, this was a first step towards allowing persistent higher inflation.  I am of the opinion that higher inflation is the inevitable conclusion to this debt super cycle debacle, but I am surprised at how calmly the market accepted this change in the Fed&#8217;s goal posts.  If 2.5% is now acceptable, how long before 3% or 4% or 5% is within their band?

Maybe the market has become so accustomed to these large numbers associated with various QE programs, bailouts, &#8216;temporary&#8217; liquidity programs, swap line expansions that a new announcement is treated with a certain amount of &#8216;being there, done that.&#8217;

I disagree with that attitude.  These last two **_programs are much different._**

  * these programs are going to directly expand the balance sheet as opposed to Operation Twist which merely changed the composition of the Fed&#8217;s assets
  * these programs have no end date, which means they are theoretically infinite
  * they are being implemented with already heightened inflation expectations
  * they are being implemented with the economy improving (although there has been a slight hiccup in the economy over the last six months, the general trend over the last 4 years has been for the economy to be improving)
  * other global Central Banks are easing much more aggressively than during other US QE programs which means that global liquidity will be much higher this time

The Fed has gone &#8216;all in&#8217; with these last two programs.  Given the fact that if asked Bernanke has indicated he does not intend to accept the post of Federal Chairman for another term, this might be Bernanke&#8217;s last kick at the can.  Monetary policy works with a lag, so these programs are really not going to be fully felt until next summer.  Bernanke might be timing his exit perfectly as I suspect that the problem of deflation will be the least of our worries next year.

Maybe you are saying to yourself, &#8220;that&#8217;s great Kevin, I accept your idea that this Fed program will create inflation, but why does that mean I should buy stocks?&#8221;  That is a great question and it is probably the conundrum that I struggle with the most.

I am of the opinion that investors have flooded into the bond market at exactly the wrong time.  I suspect that when inflation starts to rear its ugly head, the stampede out of bonds will be quite severe.  Although I believe that eventually _the rise in real rates will be the stock market&#8217;s undoing_, that is a long way off.  At first, as the money pours out of the bond market it will look for a home and equities will be a natural repository.

I firmly believe that the investment landscape is set up in a very straight forward fashion.  Yes there are a lot of negatives looming on the horizon.  Yes the long term prognosis is not very encouraging.  But the Fed is about to print, and not just a couple extra sheets of hundreds &#8211; they are about to massively expand their balance sheet.  Don&#8217;t over think it.
