This morning the Yellen relief rally has quickly faded and the S&P is once again down 10 handles.

As I mentioned yesterday, I am covering my shorts into this morning&#8217;s weakness and at this point I am pretty well flat equities on a net basis for my macro book. The fact that I have gotten flat will probably be the best argument for the bears&#8217; case as too often I get the big picture trade right, only to leave the meat of the move on the table.

At these lower prices, with the Four Horseman and Cramer Cult stocks getting clobbered like a red headed step child, I am becoming much more constructive on US equities. The process of wringing out the speculation has begun and it is gradually becoming safer to be long US stocks.

I especially like the US stock market versus the European market.

Here is a chart of the S&P 500 (in white) versus the European Stoxx 50 index (in yellow):

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="SPXvsSX5EOct0913.gif" alt="SPXvsSX5EOct0913" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/SPXvsSX5EOct0913.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" />

You will notice that for the first half of the year, the two indexes pretty well traded on top of one another.

However, the last month has seen the S&P 500 get crushed, while the Euro Stoxx 50 is right at its highs.

I am buying S&Ps versus selling EuroStoxx in a big way today.

As for the short term squiggles, I know today feels bad, but I am expecting that we are going to start to experience &#8220;rumours&#8221; about a budget settlement that will cause painful spikes higher. They will be vicious and difficult to trade. I would be careful with any shorts down here.
