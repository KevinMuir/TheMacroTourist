About a month ago I gave the long side of the gold / S&P 500 spread trade a whirl on the long side.  It didn&#8217;t work out and I cut and ran pretty quickly.

This morning I am going to try it again.

### Why am I a glutton for punishment?

For the first time in a long, long time I feel like the market is actually set up hoping for gold to go down.  It used to be that I could not find a single soul who would be advocating a short gold position.  Zero.  Nada.  Zilch.  Today it is almost the opposite.  Apart from the died in the wool long gold regulars like Sprott, Faber and Fleckenstein, there is no one telling you that you should be buying the precious metal.  In fact, there is plenty of traders who are openly betting against the metal.  Last week &#8216;the legendary&#8217; Dennis Gartman recommended a long copper short gold trade.  Fleckenstein who is in direct contact with the precious metal dealers reported that they are all expecting the precious metals to decline.  The gold price no longer has a ton of optimism built into it.

Have a look at the gold chart:

It is far from a technician&#8217;s wet dream.

Contrast that to the S&P 500:

This is the sort of chart that gets the technicians all hot and bothered.

Well anytime the technicians are telling me to buy a break out of an asset that has already been rallying for 3 months and sell the commodity that is down significantly during that same period, I wonder if they might be a little &#8216;late&#8217; to the trade.

It is difficult to catch the falling knife, but I am going to give it a try.

I am buying the gold / S&P 500 spread:

That chart looks ugly, but the long term one is much more constructive:

The ratio is a little over 1.06.  I am going to risk all the way down to 1 even.

At the back of my mind I am cognizant of the fact that gold has been rallying for almost a full decade.  I am also very concerned that gold is very sensitive to real rates, and that if the bond market backs up, this will be very bearish for gold.

However from a pure trading perspective I think this is well worth the risk reward.
