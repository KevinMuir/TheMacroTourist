In a hilarious twist of irony, the US auto workers have demanded that President Obama retaliate against the recent Japanese monetary policy moves:

From the &#8216;Automotive News&#8217; website:

> WASHINGTON (Bloomberg) &#8212; President Barack Obama should tell Japan&#8217;s new government that the U.S. will retaliate for policies aimed at weakening the yen, a group representing Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Chrysler LLC said.

> Japan&#8217;s Liberal Democratic Party, which reclaimed power last month, has let the yen continue its slide against the dollar, making U.S. auto exports relatively expensive, the American Automotive Policy Council said today in a statement.

> &#8220;We urge the Obama administration to make it clear to Japan that such policies are unacceptable and will be met by reciprocal measures,&#8221; Matt Blunt, a former Republican governor of Missouri and president of the Washington-based industry group, said in the statement.

> U.S. automakers have said the undervalued yen distorts trade and stunts job growth for American manufacturers. The group has said Japan should be blocked from joining Pacific-region trade talks that include the U.S. until the Asian nation&#8217;s auto market is more open to foreign competition.

> The yen has declined 14 percent against the dollar since Sept. 13 and fell to a 30-month low against the U.S. currency on Jan. 10. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to weaken the yen to boost his nation&#8217;s economic growth.

> Japan is &#8220;determined to repeat the &#8216;beggar thy neighbor&#8217; policies of the past,&#8221; Blunt said.

> The group wrote Obama three days before the start of his second term. His administration bailed out General Motors and Chrysler in 2010 and has made Asia a focus of U.S. trade policy.

An undervalued yen distorts trade and stunts job growth for American manufacturers?  What a laugh.  The Americans have been engaged in an aggressive policy of devaluation for a long time.  The rest of the world has finally woken up and refused to continue to bear the brunt of this American policy.  In a surprise that has shocked the Americans, man has turned around and bitten the dog instead of the other way around.

Don&#8217;t believe me?  Let&#8217;s have a look at the Federal Reserve&#8217;s balance sheet expansion versus the Bank of Japan&#8217;s over the last 5 years.

The Federal Reserve&#8217;s total assets are in yellow, while the BOJ&#8217;s total assets are in white.  As you can see, although the Federal Reserve has not endorsed an explicit policy of weakening the US dollar, it is obvious that this has been the implicit goal.  Their balance sheet has expanded at a much faster rate than the BOJ&#8217;s.

This has had an effect of weakening the USD vs the JPY.  Here is the same chart with the USDJPY rate inserted underneath:

During the period from mid 2008 to the end of 2012, the USDJPY had declined from 103.50 to 72.  This represented a decline of more than 30% for the US dollar!

The recent move in the Yen that has gotten the US auto workers so upset has merely recouped 2/3s of that decline.

But maybe the Yen has been depreciating against the US dollar during a longer time horizon and this strengthening move since 2008 has been justified.  Let&#8217;s have a look at the long term chart to get a sense of the bigger picture:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/JPY%20LT%20Jan%2021%2013.gif" />

Wrong!  The USD has been depreciating against the Yen for the last four decades!

This move from 72 to 90 is simply a refusal by the Japanese to allow the Americans to continue to gain market share through devaluation.

The idea that the US auto workers can actually complain to President Obama with a straight face is quite absurd.

Everyone wants a weak currency.  The US auto workers cannot even allow a country that has suffered one of the greatest natural disasters of all time to recoup a little economic benefit through a slight downtick in their currency without immediately complaining about it.

Have a good long hard look at the chart above and think about how little the Yen has actually moved and how quickly the response has come from the US auto workers.  Then think about whether this situation is going to get better or worse over the coming years.

I believe that we have entered into a new era of competitive devaluations that is going to cause a lot more instability in the world currency and bond markets.
