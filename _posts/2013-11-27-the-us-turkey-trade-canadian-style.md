Tomorrow our US friends take the day off for Thanksgiving. Being Canadian, we have celebrated our day of thanks more than a month ago and although it is often one of the quietest trading days of the year, the Canadian markets are open for business tomorrow.

In my mind, over the years this day seems to often have an upward bias with thin vacuum like trading. We decided to do some work and check if my &#8220;part-timers&#8221; was acting up, or if this was actually the case.

Here are the results of the TSX60 performance, buying the Wednesday night before the US Thanksgiving and selling on the Thursday Canadian close:

Only three down years over the last twenty, with a solid winning average. It certainly seems like I am remembering it correctly.

In addition to the edge that US turkey day brings, I think we might be selling off into support for the TSX60 index and be due for a small bounce. Here is the chart of the index over the last few months:

You can see that yesterday we slipped back down into the range and seem to be holding at support.

Relative to the US market, the TSX has been performing terribly over the last few days. Here it is versus the S&P500 in yellow:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/SPXTSX60Nov2713.gif" alt="SPXTSX60Nov2713" title="SPXTSX60Nov2713.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

You will notice that the TSX60 is dragging around near the lows, whereas the S&P 500 has barely corrected.

Tomorrow&#8217;s thin Canadian market might be just the time for this spread to narrow back with a seasonal rally in the TSX60 futures market.

I am going long TSX60 futures for a trade. Heck, I need something to do other than watching football tomorrow.
