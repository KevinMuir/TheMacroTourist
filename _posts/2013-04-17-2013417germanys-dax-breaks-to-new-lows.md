This morning there has been a massive wave of selling in the German stock market.  I read that 3 € billion was sold in the DAX futures pit in the less than 5 minutes.  The result was a massive drop:

This sent the DAX index to new lows for this move:

I am very bearish on the European stock market and the trading this morning is only reinforcing my view.

I am extremely worried about the financial system and believe that the recent gold volatility is a harbinger of more destabilizing moves to come.
