I must confess to a dirty little secret.  I enjoy listening to King World News interviews.  I know, I know, King World News?  Really?  It&#8217;s one step above subscribing to [Prepper websites.](http://graywolfsurvival.com/how-to-be-a-prepper/)

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/shelter1960%20Sep%2010%2013.jpg" /><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/522f1682e4b06bf96fa40afa/1378817666866/erin-burnett-yells-at%20Sep%2010%2013.png" />

For those of you who don&#8217;t know King World News, let me give you a quick summary.  If you are a financial analyst who is predicting the collapse of the fiat monetary system and CNBC will no longer give you any airtime because you look like raving lunatic, then King World News is where you go to get some airtime.

Let me stop right there before I get all the King World News doomsdayers emailing me &#8211; I am just kidding.

I think that Eric King does a remarkable job of getting some really credible guests on his radio / website.  Yes, he gives **John &#8220;too many mushrooms&#8221; Embry** and **Gerald &#8220;does Barry Manilow know you stole his wardrobe&#8221; Clemente** way too much time, but King also manages to interview top notch analysts who I respect a great deal like **Marc Faber, Bill Fleckenstein, Bill Hinde** and **Eric Sprott**.  On the whole, [Eric&#8217;s site](http://www.kingworldnews.com/kingworldnews/Broadcast/Broadcast.html) is a dirty little secret that I find quite impressive.

I give Eric King all the credit for his recent great interview of **Pierre Lassonde.**  For those who aren&#8217;t familiar with Pierre Lassonde he was Seymour Schulich&#8217;s partner during the 1970s when they founded Euro and Franco Nevada.  Although Pierre runs a lower profile than Seymour, over the years as I have listened to his views on various subjects, I have been tremendously impressed by his analysis and have come to the conclusion that their success was very much an equal partnership and that Pierre Lassonde is every bit as smart as the more revered Schulich.

Therefore as I listened to the latest interview that Pierre Lassonde gave to King World News my ears immediately perked up when he told Eric King that he was buying Kinross gold.  Here is one of the greatest gold investors out there, with his own gold projects on the go with no need to find new projects as his own will most likely need money (NewGold&#8217;s purchase of Rainy River will probably need more financing), telling you that he is purchasing another mining company in which he has no affiliation.  There is absolutely nothing in it for Lassonde.  He doesn&#8217;t need the money and he is certainly not telling King World News subscribers this news to try to pump the stock.  There is nothing but reputational downside for Lassonde if he recommends some other gold stock that ends up stinking out the joint.

I firmly believe that Lassonde told Eric King about his Kinross purchase because he feels that the stock has hit &#8220;the stupid point.&#8221;  The stock is simply so cheap that Lassonde feels compelled to buy it.  As Benjamin Graham famously described it in his famous allegory, Mr Market has hit an excessive pessimistic point.

Over my few decades of investing I have seen markets severely mis-price securities.  I am not nearly smart enough to be able to identify these points.  But I think I am shrewd enough to recognize when a truly great investor is giving me the heads up that he thinks we have hit one of those points.

I believe that Pierre Lassonde&#8217;s recommendation of Kinross Gold is just one of these times.

I am already bullish on gold stocks.  I think they are dirt cheap and I am happy to let Pierre pick a name out of the carnage of this recent vicious bear market.

I have bought Kinross Gold at this $5.70 level and will continue to add to it in the months to come.
