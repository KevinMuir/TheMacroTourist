Today is Canada Day and the MacroTourist has taken the day off to head to the cottage. Friday the Americans are on holiday for their July 4th week-end, so the MacroTourist is going to take the rest of the week off as well&#8230;

Next update will be **Monday July 6th**. By then hopefully we will have an answer to this Greek mess and trading might return to normal.

My wife gets car sick as a passenger, so when we are together, she usually drives. I feel a little like one of those old men that needs his wife to drive him around later in life when his health fails. I kid my wife that when we get to that stage, it won&#8217;t be anything new.

During this Canada Day holiday week, my wife will once again be driving me around like an old man. I thought I would leave you with this great picture of what it is like in our car&#8230;

Happy Canada Day! And to my American readers, have a great July 4th week-end!

Thanks for reading,
  
See you Monday.
