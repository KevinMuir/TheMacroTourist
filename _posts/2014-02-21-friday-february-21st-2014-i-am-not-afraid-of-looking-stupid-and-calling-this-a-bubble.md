Time stamp yourself a ticket. Mark this day down as the point where we officially entered the world of the absurd.<figure id="attachment_15011" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Yesterday, Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg consummated the largest technology deal since Time Warner&#8217;s purchase of AOL, with the purchase of the four year old company called WhatsApp.

The Zuck spent $19 billion for the 35 person company. I am not going to bother going through the metrics of the deal, there is no way to spin it as anything other than an obscene display of orgiastic excess. I understand the bulls&#8217; arguments, so there is no need to recount them to me.

When you are in the midst of a bubble, it is always difficult to stand apart from the crowd and convince the masses that they are wrong about their beliefs. Eventually you don&#8217;t bother even trying because all too often instead of the bubble popping, it merely gets bigger and even more outrageous.

That is where we are today. I have no problem standing alone and saying what other commentators only hint at for fear of looking stupid if the bubble continues. I look stupid all the time, and I understand that there is absolutely nothing stopping this bubble for continuing for many more months, quarters or even years.

But make no mistake &#8211; we are in a bubble. I am not predicting when it will end. I have no idea how long this madness will continue.

However, don&#8217;t let yourself get lulled into thinking that the bulls&#8217; arguments make sense. During the 1990&#8217;s Dot Com bubble stocks used to trade on a multiple to expenses, not sales &#8211; expenses! I am sure there were many bulls who at the time thought that this was perfectly justified, but in hindsight it is easy to realize the absurdity of that situation.

This is no different. $19 billion for a four year old messaging app is just dumb. Full stop.

No need to argue with me &#8211; you won&#8217;t convince me otherwise.

As I have listened to the bulls try to justify the overinflated price, my favourite argument of theirs is that everyone thought the Zuck overpaid when he bought Instagram for $1 billion and now look at what a steal that turned out to be. Think about that argument for a second. They are basically saying that because the bubble expanded, it makes sense to pay even more for another company. Their logic is based on the actions of the very actors who are pushing the prices higher. It is one of Soros&#8217; self reinforcing reflexivity bubbles.

At the end of the day, all of these companies are stupidly priced, and most financial commentators are so immersed in the bubble, they don&#8217;t even realize it. They are all so busy fawning over the genius of Zuckerberg that they don&#8217;t realize that he is playing them all like fools.

Well, spouting on about the stupidity of the market doesn&#8217;t really get me anything other than sympathy from the ZeroHedge types. It is more important to ask ourselves what this means for the future. How will this affect the markets?

My initial reaction was to try to short the absurdity. Surely everyone will see how naive they are paying up for companies that are throwing money out the window. However, I am already short and if there is one thing that I have learned over the years is that stupid stuff **_always gets way more stupid before it reverts to the correct price._** Shorting more into a big up move because you think it is ridiculous is a chump move.

When you see some punk driving down the highway at 150 km/h, weaving in and out of traffic, the correct move is to let him go by and have his accident somewhere else &#8211; not to try to box him in and teach him a lesson. When the market is trading with this sort of dangerous euphoria, fighting it is not worth it. I am already short and there is no need to add to it.

But that doesn&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t try to profit from this situation.  Some investors are smart enough to be able to emulate Soros who says that when he sees a bubble, he buys it. He realizes that bubbles are more likely to expand than to simply collapse. It is not in my personality to be able to climb aboard this sort of move.

I would rather think about what this bubble means to other asset classes and look for other lower risk trades.

Last night as I mulled the situation over in my mind, I realized that the most likely scenario is for the bubble to continue to expand. And if it does, that means the Fed will be even more likely to keep reducing the monetary stimulus. The Fed is rightly worried about financial conditions being too easy.

Don&#8217;t forget what the Fed debated at the last meeting:

> &#8230; Several participants suggested that risks to financial stability should appear more explicitly in the list of factors that would guide decisions about the federal funds rate once the unemployment rate threshold is crossed&#8230;

So rather than trying to trade Nasdaq futures or Facebook stock, I am going to focus on trying to take advantage of the inevitable reaction to this bubble.

This morning I am going to add to my US Treasury short position. I am already short a bunch of 2s, but I think I am also going to short some 5s.

I have no qualms about saying we are in the midst of a bubble. I fully expect to be made to look like a fool as it continues. But that is not going to deter me. The Fed&#8217;s five years of excessive monetary stimulus is being ignited and resulting in absurd technology company valuations. Who knows when it will end, but it will eventually end, an when the music does stop, just make sure you are not holding a $19 billion dollar messaging app.

<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Short Nasdaq 100 futures, short Eurostoxx futures, and short Nikkei futures.  </strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I entered the trade last Wednesday with idea that the Fed is going to taper until something breaks and that the bulls are pushing their luck.  Conviction 4.  No stops for now</span>

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index vs Long S&P 500.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities.   Conviction 5
