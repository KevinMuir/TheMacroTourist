  I started a new position a couple of days ago. It is actually a position that I have toyed with on and off over the last year. Until recently I have been flat as the position has been ripping against me and although I am the first one to say that markets often get it wrong, I am not that keen on stepping in front of freight trains.  Although the trade is not short China, it is a direct derivative and therefore the China sentiment is extremely important.  As you can see from the chart of the Chinese stock market below, the tide has dramatically turned from the end of last year where many were pessimistic about China&#8217;s fortunes, to a sense of renewed hope that maybe things are not as bad as previously feared.

<p class="p2">
  I have long been a China skeptic. I fall in the Chanos camp that questions the wisdom of assuming that ‘9 guys in the politburo’ can somehow miraculously allocate capital more efficiently than a free market capitalist society. I get a chuckle about Chanos’ observation that many of the biggest China proponents lambaste Obama or other Western leaders for their meddling with the economy, yet in the very next breath, speak about the miracle of the Chinese economy.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Over the long run, I expect that the Chinese “economic miracle” will disappoint the China bulls, much like all the other “this time is different” new era bubbles. Bob Farrell, the legendary Merrill Lynch strategist summed it best with his rule:
</p>

> There are no new eras – excesses are never permanent. Whatever the latest hot sector is, it eventually overheats, mean reverts, and then overshoots.

<p class="p2">
  I believe that China’s knee jerk massive, no monstrous, stimulus program that was instituted in the wake of the 2008 global credit crisis will prove to be one of the largest misallocations of capital ever recorded. The ghost cities, the building of the world’s largest mall which sits 95% empty or the 3rd airports in cities that should only have one, these types of infrastructure projects are going to be looked back on with horror as the bill comes due. China’s ‘economic miracle’ &#8211; although at first was based on a legitimate economic growth story, has been taken much, much too far and will prove to have more resemblance to credit bubbles than ‘economic miracles’.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  The Chinese authorities are aware of the precariousness of their situation. They realize that they cannot continue to create growth through this type of growth. They are aware that they need to rebalance from an export and capital investment based economy, to a more traditional well rounded economy. However, at the same time, they have a lot of debt and other ponzi type financing that is based on the high level of growth continuing. The authorities must balance trying to wean their economy away from these type of expectations with continuing to make the lives of their people incrementally better through higher economic growth.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  It is not going to be easy and I suspect that they will not be able to keep all the plates spinning in the air. Whether they simply drop one at a time, or whether they all come crashing to the ground in one big mess is still an unknown. But one thing I am sure of &#8211; the market is overly optimistic about the those plates staying aloft.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  The Chinese “economic miracle” of the last decade has had many investment ramifications. Most notable has been the enormous wealth created by the companies and countries that own and trade the ’stuff’ that China needed to fund their growth. From the fortunes of companies like Glencore to the enormous wealth of the countries like Brazil and Canada that export the commodities, there have been some major changes in the distribution of the world’s wealth.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  No other country has experienced this change more than Australia. Their proximity to China, combined with their abundant natural resources has made their economy the next greatest success story of this century (after of course, China).
</p>

<p class="p2">
  However, like China, the Australians have mistaken their good fortune for economic prowess. They have created a housing bubble, over-invested in capital equipment to mine the ‘things’ that China needs and in general, just spent too much. This time will not be different and Australia will under perform as the Chinese ‘economic miracle’ is deflated.
</p>

If I am correct, then the Australian economy is going to under perform and the easiest trade will be to assume that the RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) will err on the side of monetary easing. Although they have already eased a fair bit during this last year due to the global slowdown, the RBA is one of the few developed economies with non-zero rates. They still have a lot more room to ease.

<p class="p2">
  Therefore simply buying Australian fixed income or selling the AUD is an option for taking advantage of Australian economic weakness. However, the problem with this trade is that you are subject to the ‘risk on’ ‘risk off’ manic swings in the global financial system. If all of a sudden we go through a ‘risk on’ euphoria, the AUD might rally against USD even though the Australian economy is suffering. Or the AUD bonds might sell off along with global fixed income.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  A better trade would be to isolate this effect and to trade Australia against another similar currency / bond market. And there is no better partner for Australia than Canada.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  The two countries are very similar in that they have both benefited tremendously from the Chinese ‘miracle’. However, they are different in that Canada relies much more heavily on the United States and also has a much bigger exposure to energy. Given that I think that China’s transition to a more balanced economy will mean more domestic consumption which will lead to more purchases of cars, Canada’s energy resources will lead it to a relative economic outperformance versus Australia. <strong>Canada’s more balanced economy (less reliant on China), while still being a resource based economy, makes it the perfect hedge versus Australia.</strong>
</p>

<p class="p2">
  One trade that might be interesting is to short AUDCAD. This cross rate has basically been going sideways for 2 years and presents a great way to play this call.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  However, the trade I really like is to long Australian / Short Canadian fixed income. Over the last half dozen years the largest macro surprises have been the ‘Japanization’ of global interest rates. Most developed economies have been forced to lower their rates to zero levels. Australia is one of the last holdouts. My suspicion is that as the true nature of the Chinese ‘economic miracle’ becomes fully apparent, the Australian economy will sag and the RBA will join the rest of the developed world with extremely low interest rates. At the same time, I am somewhat optimistic about the North American economy and given Canada’s continued economic resilience, it is not inconceivable that Canadian rates might indeed be headed higher.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  I think you can play this trade at different parts of the yield curve.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Here is the spread of AUS 10 year yields versus CAD:

<p class="p3">
  And here is the 3 year spread:
</p>

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/Aus%20Can%203%20Yr%20Spread%20Jan%2011%2013.gif" />

The great part of this trade is that even if I am just &#8216;not wrong&#8217; the trade is going to be a winner.  There is over 150 basis points of carry at both of these points of the yield curve.  A simple status quo will result in this position slowly accruing profits.

However, I think there is a very good chance that this spread will normalize to even, and might even reach a point where Canada is yielding more than Australia.

This not a trade that is going to move around a lot.  It is going to take a while for it develop, but I am going to make it a core long term holding.  I have been patiently waiting for an opportunity to put it on, and although right now China seems to be performing admirably, the big trend is still lower.

Have a look at Iron Ore (which is one of Australia&#8217;s biggest exports):

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/Iron%20Ore%20Jan%2011%2013.gif" />

It has bounced hard from the drubbing that it took in 2011, but the trend is still lower.  Rallies should be sold.

I am starting the position by buying Australian 10s and selling equivalent Canadian 10s.
