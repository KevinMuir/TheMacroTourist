Last night Barrick Gold announced they were raising $3 billion in Canada&#8217;s biggest equity issue since 2009 with a bought deal at $18.35 USD. At the same time they announced they were shelving their troubled Pascua-Lama project and were instead using the proceeds to pay down debt.

Issuing a massively dilutive chunk of equity at a price that was last seen in 1992 (seriously have a look at the chart &#8211; I was surprised too!) shows a complete lack of faith in their business. 

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/ABXNov0113.gif" alt="ABXNov0113" title="ABXNov0113.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

The management has pulled the rip cord and given up hoping for better times.

In this Bloomberg article, this analyst came to the same conclusion as me:

> “It signals that Barrick’s board, at the margin, has become much more bearish on commodity prices,” Goldsmith, who helps manage about C$5.6 billion ($5.4 billion), said in a phone interview. “To come out with a deal as dilutive as this is, views must have changed somewhere among top-level management and the board.” 

I won&#8217;t be quite as polite. Barrick&#8217;s board, after being overly bullish and abandoning their hedging strategy in 2009, are now puking into the lows. Or at least I hope&#8230;

This is not the trade of a cagey industry leader who understood the dynamics of the market and can now take advantage of the weak hands. No, this is the trade of a over leveraged greedy major who thought that the gold price could only go one way forever. 

The fact that they have issued this equity should not be viewed as a cunning tactical move. It should rather be thought of for what it is &#8211; a massive margin call on the company level. The rating agencies were breathing down Barrick&#8217;s neck and the crushing debt was too much for them to bear at today&#8217;s gold price. 

Barrick is breaking the cardinal rule of selling when you can&#8230; not when you have to.

Hopefully this will signal the start of the capitulation stage and set the stage for putting in a long term bottom for gold stocks.
