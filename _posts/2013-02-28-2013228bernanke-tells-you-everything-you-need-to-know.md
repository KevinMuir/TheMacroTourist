Sometimes the clues come where you least expect it. &nbsp;Although you would think that Bernanke&#8217;s comments in front of Congress would centre on domestic issues, I believe that this exchange has very important ramifications for Japanese monetary policy. &nbsp;During a testy exchange with Bob Corker, Bernanke said the following:

> CORKER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. **When the Fed decided it was going to stimulate a global currency war as it did, did you &#8212; did you embark on that thinking, well you know, our country&#8217;s in trouble and let&#8217;s &#8212; sort of the heck with everybody else,** or did you think it would leverage the &#8212; the wealth effect, if you will, **if everybody had a race to the bottom?**

> I know the Fed **_has been really purposeful in trying to create this sort of faux wealth effect._** Did you think it would multiply your efforts? And speaking to that, so overall wealth effect &#8212; I know you all do calculations all the time, but could you tell us exactly what sort of the wealth effect is, the part of it that&#8217;s not real, **that if you were to stop doing what you&#8217;re doing** as it relates to monetary supply today, **how much of a diminishment in national wealth would take place?**

> _BERNANKE:_ On the first question, **we&#8217;re not engaged in a currency war**. We&#8217;re not targeting our currency. The G-7 put out a statement, which was very clear, that it&#8217;s entirely appropriate for countries to use monetary policy to address their domestic objectives, in our case employment and price stability.

> Our position is that our expansionary monetary policies, which are being replicated, of course, in other industrial countries, are increasing demand globally and helping not only our businesses but the businesses in other countries that export to us.

> And so this is not a beggar thy neighbor policy; **it&#8217;s one that benefits our trading partners.**

Corker was understandably worried about the Fed being the aggressor in this currency war. &nbsp;In response, Bernanke clearly outlined what I believe is the new Central Banker dogma of how they are going to justify their new policies; **no amount of printing is &#8216;too much&#8217; as long as inflation is running below target and the economy is underperforming. &nbsp;**This idea that all other considerations, such as the value of your currency, are abandoned for these domestic policy goals is the new mantra. &nbsp;Therefore given that the Japanese inflation rate is below target, they are &#8216;allowed&#8217; under the new Central Banker order to print as much as needed. &nbsp;The fact that the Yen is going down is just a side note. &nbsp;The Japanese are allowed to pursue their own domestic economic goals without worry about the effect on the rest of their trading partners. &nbsp;If the end result is that their partners experience deflation due to a rising currency (relative to the Yen), then they are free to pursue their own economic goals independently.

This might seem like an obvious conclusion, but you need to put this in context of the global economic system. &nbsp;In the past the G20 would have been much more critical of a nation which was inflating so aggressively. &nbsp;The other Central Bankers would have been bemoaning the unintended consequences of such actions. &nbsp;This time they are basically giving Japan the green light to print as much as they like. &nbsp;Bernanke just sanctioned the Japanese policy!

> _BERNANKE_: **Well, Senator, I should comment that although the Fed hasn&#8217;t had a balance sheet this size, other central banks, like the Japanese, for example, have.**

> _SHELBY_: And they paid for it, too, hadn&#8217;t they?

> _BERNANKE_: Well, depends on your point of view. The current prime minister thinks they haven&#8217;t done enough.

> _SHELBY_: What do you think?

> _BERNANKE_: I think that they should try to get rid of deflation. I support their attempts to get rid of deflation.

My conclusion from this admission is that the world&#8217;s major Central Banks have put deflation squarely on the number one enemy list.

Just as Volcker drew a line in the sand when he cranked rates to snuff out inflation, Bernanke and his other Central Banker&nbsp;brethren&nbsp;have made a similar pledge regarding deflation.

It is now obvious to me that the printing will continue, and in fact accelerate until inflation reaches the Central Banks targets. &nbsp;What is the line &#8211; &#8216;the beatings will continue until moral improves?&#8217; &nbsp;That is what will happen here. &nbsp;The Central Banks will achieve their inflation targets come hell or high water. &nbsp;They have given themselves the political cover to do so, and they are all on the same page (except for the ECB).

### Trading strategy

I think that this open admission by Bernanke cements in my mind two trades. &nbsp;

The first is the most obvious one &#8211; the Yen should be sold again. &nbsp;It is clear that the other Central Bankers have implicitly agreed to aggressive Japanese reflation. &nbsp;There is very little chance that they are going to object to further Yen devaluation (as long as the Japanese don&#8217;t explicitly target a rate). &nbsp;I had been trading the Yen from the long side due to the overcrowded nature of the trade. &nbsp;Yesterday I covered and went flat. &nbsp;Today I am restating my short position. &nbsp;For now I am going to put on a third of the position, looking to scale into the full amount. &nbsp;At the end of the day I need to remember that the surprises are always in the direction of the trend. &nbsp;I was probably more lucky than I realize trading the Yen on the long side. &nbsp;No more! &nbsp;Short positions only given Bernanke&#8217;s comments.

The second trade is a little more nuanced. &nbsp;Given the commitment to achieving their inflation targets through monetary expansion, I think my short bond positions in various G7 markets should be expanded. &nbsp;I believe Bernanke & Co. when they say they are going to print until inflation expectations rise or employment improves. &nbsp;Given that in the US most inflation indicators are running 50 basis points below their 2% target, I think that we will see inflation rise in the coming months/years. &nbsp;And I ask you, when have you ever seen a market not overshoot a target? &nbsp;The odds favour them getting it wrong and skidding right through 2%. &nbsp;Even though the Federal Reserve and other Central Banks will be buying bonds to achieve their target, don&#8217;t get fooled by that notion. &nbsp;If they are successful, they will usher in one of the greatest bond bear markets of all time. &nbsp;I am shorting more bonds this morning.

Bernanke&#8217;s testimony in front of Congress gave some real insight into how&nbsp;committed&nbsp;the world&#8217;s Central Bankers actually are. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t fight them, but do not assume they are going to be successful in reflating financial assets. &nbsp;Instead focus on the more likely unintended consequences like an overshooting of inflation.</p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p></p>
