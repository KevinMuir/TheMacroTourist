Over the last month I have been busy catching the falling knives in the world bond markets. For my medium term trading I have been lucky enough to have actually gotten this trade right, and yields have fallen across the board.

Although I am very concerned that the world economy is not nearly as strong as the market believes, I am not convinced that being long the bond market is the best way to play it. Just as I have argued that you didn&#8217;t need run away inflation to have a bond bear market, I am concerned that economic weakness need not automatically cause bonds to rise either.

The damage to the bond market over the last 6 months has been massive and for me to assume that the bond bull market will resume just because the economy slows is probably naive. In the absence of other information, the trade is probably to assume that the bond bear market continues.

Therefore I am going to get flat to slightly short the various world bond markets this morning.

US 10 Year yields have hit support. Yes, they might break support, but that is probably not the correct bet. I was lucky enough to have bought higher yields and it is probably time to head to the door.

German 10 year yields are way below the US. I was long this bond market in my long term book (from lower yields and I was offside big time) and I am going to to take this slight drop in yields to cut my losses.
