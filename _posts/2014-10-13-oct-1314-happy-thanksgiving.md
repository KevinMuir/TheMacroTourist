It is Canadian Thanksgiving today (due to the colder weather, our harvest is earlier than the Americans&#8217;, and our Thanksgiving is a month earlier.) Â Mrs. Macrotourist has given strict orders of no trading. Instead of staring at the screens, I am going to focus on getting to work cooking the wonderful new dish that my best high school friend sent me. You see, he has long considered me a little bit of a North American centric country bumpkin. In an attempt to convince me of the joys of travelling through the world, my pal likes to send me pictures of all the appetizing dishes he is eating. Well this one looked too delicious to pass up, so I have decided to cook it up for Thanksgiving.

Happy Thanksgiving everyone!
