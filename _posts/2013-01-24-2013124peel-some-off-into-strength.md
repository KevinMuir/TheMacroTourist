One of my favourite expressions is &#8216;some people were lucky enough to be born smart, while others were smart enough to be born lucky.&#8217;  I count myself as lucky for catching this latest move up in the stock market.

Whereas I used to be much lonelier in my bullish view, it has become a little more crowded.

Do not misunderstand this nuanced change in my posture.  I am still bullish.  I still think you should err on being long.

But it is time to peel some of the position off into strength.

The next two days have larger POMO operations:

With the poor action in cr-APPL following their earnings release, the market has a rather bearish feel to it this morning.

However, I do not believe you should sell into this morning&#8217;s hole.  Take a deep breath and wait.  Sell into strength that will hopefully develop later today and tomorrow as the POMO&#8217;s effect kicks in.
