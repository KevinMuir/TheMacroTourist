Tomorrow the 2 day Fed meeting ends, and Bernanke & Co. have to let the world know if they are ready to pull back on the QE juicing.

I don&#8217;t have a strong feeling about what the Fed is going to do.  I know that given the tepid recovery in employment they would prefer to keep printing, but at the same time they also understand that there are increasing signs that monetary conditions are excessively loose and causing worrisome risk taking.

I find it ironic that even though after the 2008 credit crash everyone was quick to point the finger at Greenspan for leaving rates &#8220;too low for too long&#8221;, these same pundits are now oblivious to the massive distortions that Bernanke&#8217;s Fed have created.

My suspicion is that the current Fed is very much aware of the tough spot they have put themselves.  I doubt they ever wanted to provide as much easing as they felt they were forced to inject.  It is easy to forget that it was only a short while ago that the budget impasse forced President Obama to curtail government spending and cause the Fed to pull up the slack with an expanded QE program.

Now, with the monetary stimulus kicking in and causing financial asset prices to rise, the Fed is aware that it is having a limited effect on the real economy, yet at the same time creating all sorts of unstable pockets of speculative activity.   Not only that, it seems to be having the effect of simply making the rich richer, with limited benefits to the poorer members of society that are struggling from the aftermath of the bursting of the credit super cycle.

As I write this I realize that regardless of whether the employment has actually improved, it is probably time for the Fed to start the withdrawal of the stimulus.  As Bernanke likes to note, the risk reward benefits of further stimulus no longer make sense.

The Fed will most likely come to the same conclusion.  My hope is that they realize is that there is really no good time to withdraw the stimulus and they might as well get to work on the messy job.

It is a near impossible task.  The market at all times will want their stimulus.

The only real question is how fast it is withdrawn and what is built into the current price.

I firmly believe that QE is stock friendly and bond negative, so if the Fed surprises with a more aggressive withdrawal schedule, then after the initial negative reaction in the bond market, I think the trade will be to buy bonds and short stocks.  If the Fed chickens out, then I expect the bond bear market to accelerate.
