> Adding to the overheated climate was growing friction between the United States and West Germany over currency valuations. Baker said on “Meet the Press” on Sunday, October 18, “We will not sit back in this country and watch surplus countries jack up their interest rates and squeeze growth worldwide on the expectation that the United States somehow will follow by raising its interest rates.” Questioned moments after the show (and off-camera) by an influential economist, Henry Kaufman, about the wisdom of making such a strong statement, Baker replied, “Henry, some things need to be said.”

This famous incident occurred during the week-end of October 18th, 1987. Although there were other reasons for the stock market crash, many market historians blame James Baker&#8217;s rash talk as one of the major contributing factors for the ensuing market crash. There were of course other reasons &#8211; like a bond market that had been backing up for a year, an over enthusiastic investing community, and the general belief that nothing could derail the fabulously performing market.

All of these of course are factors that we should not worry about today as our 5 year bull market is based on sound fundamentals from a robust economy with very little excess leverage or exuberance in the system and a bond market that is showing no signs of any weakness.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

So yesterday when US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew made the following comments about Japan&#8217;s economy, I did not worry one iota:

> *LEW SAYS JAPAN NEEDS TO \`GET THEIR DOMESTIC ECONOMY GROWING&#8217;
> 
> *LEW SAYS JAPAN CAN&#8217;T RELY ON FX RATE FOR ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE

Surely Mr. Lew did not mean to imply that the US Administration is telling others how to run their economy.<figure style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Why it was only 5 years ago that the US almost took down the entire financial system with their reckless financial speculating &#8211; so there is no way that they would forget so quickly and think that they can lecture other nations about how to run their economies.

> *LEW SAYS CHINA’S GOAL SHOULD BE TO OPEN MARKETS
  
> *LEW SAYS FX AND OTHER REFORMS ARE GOOD FOR CHINA’S ECONOMY
  
> *LEW SAYS SOME EUROPEAN NATIONS NEED TO DO MORE TO BOOST DEMAND
  
> *LEW SAYS EUROPE NEEDS TO GET GROWTH TO HIGHER LEVEL
  
> *LEW SAYS EUROPE IS NOT COMPLETELY OUT OF THE WOODS

I am glad that the US is so mindful of the fact that in this global financial system in which they lead, they have been the most aggressive and consistent in regards to Quantitative Easing.  This QE has caused massive distortions that have played havoc to the entire global financial system as other countries have been forced to deal with the mind boggling large monetary easing program from the largest economy on the planet.

The Americans also obviously need no reminding of the fact that after 2008 credit crisis descended, the American&#8217;s response of a massive Quantitative Easing program was actually one of the root causes of a massive appreciation in the Japanese Yen:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I am also so very thankful that the current Yen weakness that Lew is publicly bemoaning is not one that with a record speculative short position. Geez, if that were the case, it might get ugly if the US were to continue to apply pressure regarding the Yen&#8217;s weakness and cause the shorts to cover.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I am glad that the USDJPY rate does not in any way seem to be move on a 1 for 1 basis with the US stock market because if the US were to escalate tensions regarding the value of the Yen, it might actually cause the stock market to go down.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

And finally, good thing that a US Treasury Secretary publicly feuding with another country about the value of the currency has never been the trigger for a market crash.

Now don&#8217;t misinterpret my sarcastic ramblings. I am not calling for a market crash. And I obviously am the only one who seems to be worried about Jack&#8217;s lecturing the rest of the world about the value of their currency because the foreign exchange markets basically yawned at the speech.

**But I do worry that this is a shot across the bow for the Japanese. Up until now the US has implicitly given its blessing to the Yen&#8217;s devaluation. This is the first time since that tacit approval was signalled to the market that the US Administration has commented about the value of the Yen.**

My guess is that the Americans (and to a large degree the Europeans as well) are feeling the economic pressure from the forever falling Yen.  Japan is exporting their deflation to the rest of the world, and the Americans have finally hit a point where they have had enough.

I do not know how this will play out. But I do know that there are a lot of Yen shorts, and if the Americans are going to attempt to strong arm the Japanese to stop their devaluation, then at the very least, at the margin we are going to get some weaker shorts covering.

I am going to take a small trading long position in Yen. I hate to do this as I know the long term big picture trend is down. And not only do I think it is lower, but I think it will eventually go a lot lower.

However, I am going to ask the Market Gods&#8217; mercy for fading such a strong trend, and will buy Yen, risking down to the previous lows from last week.

And finally, I am going to swap a portion of my long volatility position in US Treasury bonds into Yen. I think the era of quiet Japanese Yen devaluation might be over and if the US Administration is signalling that they will not tolerate more weakness, this very well might introduce a lot more volatility into the FX pair.

**Things that I am watching**

**Weekly initial claims**

Yesterday the US government released their weekly Initial Jobless Claims and Continuing Claims. The Initial Claims came in at 326k, which was pretty much bang on expectations. The Continuing claims were 3030k which was much above the expected 2850k.

Although this is a very simple model, the S&P 500 has tended to track the inverted claims:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="SPXvsClaimsJan1614.gif" alt="SPXvsClaimsJan1614" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/SPXvsClaimsJan1614.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">S&P 500 (orange line) vs Inverted Weekly Jobless Claims (white line)</figcaption></figure> 

Lately, there has been a fair amount of noise in the continuing claim series (the government has cited problems with a new system of reporting), but in the past couple of months, this model does not seem to be confirming the S&P&#8217;s recent advance. Yet another model where the S&P has diverged to the upside without any confirmation&#8230;

**The Russell 2000 Small Cap Stocks Index &#8211; the most perfect trendline in existence**

The rise in US small cap stocks has been phenomenal. In 2013 they were up more than 30%. However, what is truly amazing is how orderly the advance was. It was almost like someone was methodically moving the stocks up. It all happened with barely a hiccup.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="IWMJan1614.gif" alt="IWMJan1614" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/IWMJan1614.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Russell 2000 ETF</figcaption></figure> 

I am not a big technician, but even I have to admit that this has to be one of the most perfect trend lines in existence&#8230; I am keeping it on the radar as any breaking of that trend line will most likely cause some selling out of the sheer fact that so many people will be watching it.

**Positions**

****UPDATE:  Long Yen.****  This is a counter trend trade where I am just begging the Market Gods to punish me.  However, I do believe that the Yen is oversold and due for a move higher.  The Americans shot across the bow might very well be the catalyst. **** **Conviction: 2.  **Stops are last weeks low in Yen terms.

**UPDATE:  Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**UPDATE:  Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Short S&P 500.    **I still believe the risk reward favours the short side.  **We are so close to new highs that you need to steel yourself for the potential breakout, but I am not going to cover into any squeeze and will sit tight into new highs.  I suspect if we do have a break out, it will be a last gasp.  Be ready for a &#8220;pop and drop&#8221;.  **Conviction: 4

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

**Short Canadian dollar.** CAD continues to quietly sink.  Conviction level: 4. Stops to come.  **Short CAD against JPY and EUR.**  Small position size.

**Long various natural gas contracts.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather. Conviction level: 3 No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 6
