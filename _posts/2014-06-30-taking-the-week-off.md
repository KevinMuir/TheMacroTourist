Up here in the Great White North, we are celebrating Canada Day on Tuesday.  Some of us are making an extra long week-end by skipping work on Monday.

Then the US is celebrating July 4th on Friday, so I suspect many of my American friends will be making an already short week, even shorter.

Due to the fact that I trade both Canadian and US markets, I have decided to compromise and just take off the whole week.

**Regular daily updates will resume next Monday, July 7th.**

Happy Canada Day and July 4th!

PS:  for those who are trading from the short side with me, I know it seems scary&#8230; but don&#8217;t forget (at least for this roll):
