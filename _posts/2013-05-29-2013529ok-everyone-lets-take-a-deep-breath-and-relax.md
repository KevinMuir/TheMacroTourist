Over the past couple of weeks there has been a hyperbolic assault about the dangers from the rise in yields emanating from the financial media.

Instead of joining in on the litany of those sounding the alarm bells, I am going to suggest that everyone take a deep breath and relax.

One day the rise in rates in going to be a problem.  A big problem.  In fact, I think that ultimately all these super destructive long term policies of easy money with no fiscal discipline will continue until the bond market institutes some discipline on the politicians and the public.  I believe that Bill Fleckenstein has nailed the long term macro analysis when he predicts that nothing will change until the bond market revolts.  However that day is not today.

Is this backup in yields the start?  Maybe.  But you can&#8217;t even call it an uprising yet.

Let&#8217;s take a step back and have a look at yields to see if this worry is warranted:

This is the 30 year Treasury Bond yield over the last year.  It certainly has been moving higher.  From 2.60% in May of 2012 to 3.29% this morning.  That seems like a pretty large percentage move, maybe I am wrong about this not being a big deal&#8230;

However before I join the ranks of the chicken littles, let&#8217;s zoom out and have a look at a little longer time frame:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/US%2030%20Yr%20Max%20May%2029%2013.gif" />

That move from 2.60% to 3.29% is barely a blip.  This latest rise is far from being a big deal and if we should have been freaking out about anything, it was the fact that 30 year bond yields got down to 2.60%.  That was the thing to freak out about &#8211; not the fact that they have lifted 60 basis points to 3.20%.

We have forgotten how truly stupidly low interest rates had gotten.

And now, we run the risk of not understanding how high these rates can go.

So, let me repeat &#8211; I think rates are going higher, a lot higher.  I just don&#8217;t think it is going to cause an immediate problem.  Nor do I think that this latest move up in rates is a big deal, it is the farthest thing from a big deal.  It is simply the start.

When rates are moving up 100 basis points in a week, then I will say we have a problem.  But right now, this backup in yields is the result of an improved forecast for the global economy.

What?  I know you are now wondering if I am truly off my rocker.  The conventional wisdom is that the economy is rolling over, why on earth do I think things are going to get better?

The simple fact is that QE is working.  That is why yields are rising.  The animal spirits are reviving and the money velocity is at least staying stable as the two major Central Banks of the US and Japan inject gazillions (a technical term) into the system.

As long as they don&#8217;t get scared and withdraw their stimulus too early, the global economy is on its way to a self sustaining recovery.  That is what bond yields are telling you.

And if that happens, and the money velocity stops going down, given the massive amount of Central Bank reserves that have been added since the 2007 credit crisis, it would not take much for a small spark to light a massive inflationary fire.  That is when you should worry.  When the Fed gets scared about what they have created.  Or when Japan prints too much Yen to the point where their currency is dropping 5-10% a day, instead of over a month.  But until then, the stage is set for a risky asset rally combined with a global bond bear market.

Don&#8217;t forget that stocks can go up with rates for a long time:

Notice how between 2000 and 2007, the US 2 year yield marched higher along with stocks?  Higher rates don&#8217;t necessarily mean lower risky asset prices.

I understand it is much more complicated than that and I am by no means suggesting you go and buy stocks.  I think shorting the bond market is an infinitely better risk reward trade than buying stocks.  However, I am saying for everyone to take a deep breath and relax &#8211; rising rates from record setting multi generational lows is not going to kill us.

In fact my suspicion is that the Fed is going to be slow to raise rates and the curve will become record steep&#8230;. but that is a story for another day.

I also believe that rising rates, contrary to the basic laws of supply and demand (lower price equals greater demand&#8230; usually), will cause those individuals and companies that have been waiting on the sidelines to rush in for fear of missing the last chance to lock in low rates.  Perversely, the rise in rates will cause the economy to strengthen over the medium term.

I am bullish on the global economy.  Rising global rates is not the death knell everyone is predicting&#8230;  at least not yet.
