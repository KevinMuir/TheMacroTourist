Although right now Kurodeuphoria is causing a mad dash into all financial assets, there are going to be some real repercussions for the long term health of the economies that compete with Japan.  Many financial commentators have rightly pointed out that Korea and China must be very concerned about the sudden appreciation of their currency.  Although I do think that Japan&#8217;s policies will prove challenging for the rest of Asia, if their economies turn sharply lower, those countries will be able to actively devalue to compete.  I don&#8217;t think it will be very long before Korea gets aggressive in following Japan down the road of excessively easy monetary policy.  And as for China, although they do have inflation issues, they are also not adverse to managing their currency when it suits them.  The rest of Asia is going to adapt just fine and manage through the Japanese stimulus.

However, there is another region where this Japanese stimulus is going to prove disastrous.  Europe&#8217;s fiscal situation is way more precarious, their economies are sitting on the edge of really breaking down, and thanks to their structure (basically thanks to the fact that they let the Germans into the Euro), they have very little ability to aggressively ease monetary policy.  Although right now Japanese hot money is flowing into European financial assets, this is not really helping their long term competitiveness problems.  Yes, it helps them fund their debts cheaply in the short run, but in the long run, it makes the BMWs, Audis, BOSCH, etc&#8230; all the more expensive on global stage.  The EuroYen rate has appreciated 31% in the last 4 months.  The European manufacturers need this about as much America needs another reality TV show:

When the Yen was in the midst of their spectacular move down to 75 USDJPY in the midst of the 2011 global contraction, I was adamant that the Japanese economy would prove unable to deal with this sort of pressure.  This forecast proved prescient as the terrible recession that they subsequently experienced ultimately ushered in the radical policies we are now being exposed to.

**I am just as adamant that this Euro strength is going to prove fatal to the European economy.** 

Europe needs a lower Euro so they can compete and grow their way out of their terrible fiscal situation.  Having hot money rush into the area simply reduces the borrowing costs over the short run, thus discouraging the politicians from making the much needed reforms to increase competitiveness.  Then the actual economy eventually keels over from the weight of a declining manufacturing sector.

However, they are not going to get a lower Euro because of the nature of their union.  And as the Euro rises, everything will appear fine for the short run.  The hot money will put off the funding crisis that many of the PIIGS nations face.  Yet, bit by bit, the European economies will slip ever more into debt, with higher unemployment and less chance of ever being able to actual grow their way out of the deflationary trap.

I am short European stocks, and although it is hurting like a wisdom tooth extraction with no anesthetic, I am sticking with the trade.  The EURJPY rise is sowing the seeds for European stocks&#8217; eventual big fall.
