My coworker Ryan likes to kid me about the fact that no good ever comes when I lift a leg of a spread trade.

In a desperate attempt to prove him wrong, I am going to chance a leg lifting in regards to my long AUDJPY short S&P 500 trade.

The trade has worked fairly well, as I am onside on both pieces.  However, I am increasingly getting bearish on the stock market and instead of adding to the trade, I am going to simply sell my long AUDJPY trade and leave the short S&P leg.

Will I break the streak of consistently lifting legs at the most inopportune moment?  Stay tuned to find out.
