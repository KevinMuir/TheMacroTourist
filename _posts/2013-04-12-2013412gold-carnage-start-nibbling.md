Last week I stopped myself out on the my long Gold / short S&P 500 futures spread.  Good thing as the gold carnage is continuing this morning:

On a relative basis the stock market is hanging in there quite well, so the ratio has plunged today:

In my other post I said that I would try a long position again at 0.925.  Today we have moved all the way down to 0.95, so I am giving you the heads up that my initiating target is moving closer very quickly.

I might even start nibbling on the position before we reach my target.  Today has a real &#8216;panicky&#8217; feel to it and I think you can start establishing a position.  There is no rush as the volatility is huge, but you should definitely have the blue tickets out today for the gold, not the pinks.
