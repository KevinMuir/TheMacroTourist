I am getting very nervous about the markets and although on the whole I am positioned &#8216;risk off&#8217;, I am going to clean up some of the trades that have not been working for me.

So this post is just a housekeeping note that I am giving up on my short BAX futures trade.  If you recall, this was a bet that short rates would go higher in Canada.  Although I am by no means betting on them being lowered, I think the sidelines is a better place to be.

So I am covering this position at a loss.   A TSX floor trader that I used to work with had a great saying that seems very applicable today &#8211; &#8216;slay your dragons while they are small.&#8217;  Wise advice&#8230;
