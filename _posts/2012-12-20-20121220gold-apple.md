Lately there has been a lot of confusion regarding the poor performance of both gold and Apple during the last few months.

Although I was indeed a big Apple bear this summer, I am much more neutral on the stock right now.  I do believe the market is coming to realize that there are increasing competitive pressures that are weighing on Apple stock, but the real reason for the aggressive selling has very little to do with fundamentals.

The real reason that Apple has performed so badly this month is the same reason gold continues to sell off &#8211; tax rates on capital gains are going up next year.

Apple and gold are probably the two biggest wealth creators for investors over the last few years.  Investors are quite rightly realizing their massive capital gains in an attempt to optimize their tax situation.  This is causing heavy trading in both gold and Apple.

Have a look at this chart of gold and Apple.  It is not a coincidence that the two have traded very similarly since this summer.

The selling should be approaching its end as we are quickly reaching the cut off for trading in the 2012 calendar year.  Instead of getting bearish on these two names, I am bullish, playing for a trading bounce as we turn over the calendar into 2013.
