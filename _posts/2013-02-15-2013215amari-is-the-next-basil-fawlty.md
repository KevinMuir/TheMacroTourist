In a move that in contrast makes the staff of Fawlty Towers seem well organized, the Japanese Economics Minister Amari has clarified his previous speech about the Nikkei:

> &#8220;GOVERNMENT HAS NO TARGET FOR STOCK MARKET&#8221;

Really?  Seriously?

How does that square with this comment from a few days ago?

> “It will be important to show our mettle and see the Nikkei reach the 13,000 mark by the end of the fiscal year (March 31),” Amari said in a speech.

His comments have about as much credibility as John Cleese&#8217;s character Basil Fawlty that there was no rat at Fawlty Towers!

The Japanese government is consistently showing that they really don&#8217;t have any clue how to manage their economy.  There is no real plan and they seem to be simply shooting from the hip.

I am not sure yet how this is going to play out, but I am becoming seriously concerned that there is going to be a large accident in the Japanese financial markets.  It might take the form of a Yen that accelerates to the downside and the Japanese government loses control, or it might be a JGB sell off that destroys their economy, but I am getting more and more convinced that the chances of them managing this process in an orderly manner is about as likely as Fawlty Towers being voted best managed hotel in Britain.
