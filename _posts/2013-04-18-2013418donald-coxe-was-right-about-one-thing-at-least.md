I always enjoy listening to the great strategist Donald Coxe.  Over the last year or so I have found myself disagreeing with him more than usual, but I try hard to listen to people who hold opposing opinions to myself as a way to continually question my theories.

Coxe is one of the main religious leaders for the Church of &#8216;China will grow at 10% forever.&#8217;  I am in firm opposition to this doctrine and believe that China is simply one of the greatest credit bubbles of all time.  Therefore, Coxe and I have widely differing views on the direction of many asset classes.

However, one thing that I happen to agree with Coxe is his opinion about the ramifications about the creation of a gold ETF.  When the GLD ETF was first proposed, regulators asked many market participants for their opinion of whether this should be allowed.  Almost everyone was in favour &#8211; except for Coxe.  He felt that a gold ETF would change the very nature of gold.  By allowing it into stock accounts, it would take on more of the characteristics of a stock.  It would be subject to the same stresses as any other stock during times of liquidation.

Although I do not agree with Coxe in his opinion that they should have never created a gold ETF, I am in agreement that by doing so, they changed the very nature of gold.

I have long been warning about gold (and Apple) because of the over crowded concentration amongst hedge funds.  I have found these hedge funds travel in packs, and there is nothing I hate more than to be long something that is in the top 5 holdings of the majority of hedge funds.  When these hedge funds decide to sell, there is often no one left to sell to, and the damage is vicious (see AAPL).

Last summer, when the stock market dipped and gold was hitting new highs, the market capitalization for the GLD ETF was larger than the market capitalization for the SPIDERs 500 trust!  Think about that for a second.  Let it really sink in.  The GLD ETF was the largest ETF in the world!

That is absolutely insane.  Although I understand the merits of owning gold, it should never, ever in a million years be a bigger holding than stocks in anyone&#8217;s long term portfolio.  At the end of the day, Buffet&#8217;s skepticism of gold is correct.  It doesn&#8217;t earn anything, it doesn&#8217;t produce anything.  It is basically economically useless.  The only thing that it does is protect you against the incompetency of economists and politicians who seem intent on driving our system into the ground.

Although I am long term skeptical of owning gold, I am currently even more skeptical of the economic system as a whole.  As I have written before, if gold was going down because the Central Banks around the world were normalizing interest rates and moving real interest rates from deeply negative levels to traditionally positive levels, then I would be all aboard the short gold trade.  However, the very opposite is happening.  Central Banks are increasingly engaging in more financial repression and moving real rates into even more deeply negative levels.

**So why is gold going down?**  Back to our friend Donald Coxe.  One of the main reasons gold is going down is because of the massive speculation that had occurred amongst the hedge fund community.  Gold is no longer trading like a safe haven, but more like a trading sardine that leveraged players like to pass around.  Coxe&#8217;s concerns have been realized.  I am quite convinced that the boys from Greenwich thought they outsmarted everyone by front running the collapse of the monetary system.  However, instead of hyper inflation rearing its ugly head immediately, the Central Bankers have managed to force everyone into stocks and other financial assets, thus making the hedgies panic.  When you combine that with the fact that gold is a source of funds for a European economy that is increasingly in need of capital, you have the perfect storm for gold.  Gold is simply unwinding many of the excesses that were introduced through the creation of the ETF.

In yesterday&#8217;s post, I included the great Philosoraptor cartoon that Zero Hedge highlighted.  In it, the dinosaur questioned &#8220;If everyone is selling their gold, then I wonder who is buying?&#8221;  The reality is that gold is shifting from the hedge funds and other speculators, into the hands of long term holders.  Although this seems backwards, I am happy when the hedgies sell something and the public buys it.  The purchase of physical gold by individuals moves it to a much stronger set of hands than the hedgies, who are subject to month to month performance pressure.

The US Mint reported that so far this month, the physical gold sales is off the charts (again from ZH):

Even though we are only half way through April, it is already a record month in terms of physical gold sales.  The hedgies might be puking up gold bits, but the public is happy to mop up their discards.

How long will this process take?  Who knows.  All I am sure of is that Donald Coxe was right &#8211; the creation of the GLD ETF forever changed the nature of gold.
