### **Canada sucking wind**

Yesterday the Canadian dollar was hit with a double dose of bad news.

The first was the Ivey Purchasing Managers index which showed that the index has slipped below 50 signifying that the economy was contracting. It came in at a disappointing 46.3.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

&nbsp;

The second bit of bad news was when Bank of Canada Governor Poloz said that he was worried about Canadian inflation _undershooting target._

This comment was somewhat understandable given the recent CPI figures:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="CanadaCPIJan0713.gif" alt="CanadaCPIJan0713" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/CanadaCPIJan0713.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Canadian CPI YoY Change</figcaption></figure> 

&nbsp;

Canadian inflation is running at 0.9% on a year over year basis, with very little signs of any sort of uptick on the horizon.

Even though the comments were somewhat to be expected, the market interpreted this as to mean that maybe Governor Poloz was leaning a little more dovish than they would have previously guessed.

The market took both of these developments as an excuse to push the CAD to new lows against the USD (new highs in the USDCAD rate):<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

&nbsp;

As I mentioned yesterday, I am by no means a raging bear on the Canadian economy, but there can simply be no denying that the commodity bear market of the last year has had a very large effect on our economy.

When the 2008 credit crisis hit, at first Canada suffered along with the rest of the global economy. However, as China aggressively stimulated through massive fiscal expansion, the commodity countries very quickly bounced back. This included Canada and for the few years after 2008, the Canadian economy out performed the US. The Canadian rebound was made all the more potent as during the years leading up to the credit crisis, the Canadian consumer had not incurred anywhere near the same amount of debt as their US counterparts, so the massive decline in global interest rates was much effective at encouraging spending in Canada. And spend we did.

The Canadian economy emerged from the 2008 credit crisis to be greeted by a China with a voracious appetite for our commodities, a consumer with less debt than most of the other Western economy&#8217;s consumers, a banking system that through our inherently conservative nature had not gotten into anywhere near the same trouble as most other Western banks and finally an exceptionally low global interest rate environment. It was in fact almost nirvana for our economy.

However, as is typical in financial markets, we confused a bull market for being smart. We began to think that our crap didn&#8217;t smell and proceeded to blow a massive housing bubble. Not only that, even though the shrill China bulls had ensured us that they would always be the insatiable demand for our commodities, the mining industry did what it always does (only way bigger) and expanded much too aggressively based on overly optimistic assumptions. Many China bulls told us that this time was different, but it never is.

Fast forward to today. The mining industry is a disaster and companies are closing mines, reducing production, and abandoning expansion plans at a fierce rate. Canada had become the world&#8217;s leading capital market for resource companies and the massive commodity slump has had a predictable effect on our finance industry. As for our housing market, the Canadian consumer is no longer a prudent example of someone with a conservative debt level, and instead most Canadians are forced to deal with a over stretched expensive housing market that can barely be sustained even with imprudent amounts of leverage.

Many hedge funds believe that the Canadian housing market is a bubble every bit as dangerous as the US bubble of 2002-2006. I am not inclined to agree with them, and as I told one of them &#8211; &#8220;we are going to bore you with our Canadian-ness.&#8221; Although I am hard pressed to believe that Canadian real estate will generate _positive real rates of return_ in the coming years, I don&#8217;t think that it will be anywhere near as bad as the American experience. Real estate is boring. The type of bubble that the US had was very unique in that there was a tremendous amount of leverage combined with a lot of fraud. It was a perfect storm that would have made George Clooney proud.

The Canadian housing bust will be a long drawn out boring affair.

And I believe we have entered the meat of it.

That is why I think the best trade is probably to short the Canadian dollar. Canada is going to solve its problem by leaving rates lower than they should be for longer. This will cause the Canadian dollar to weaken. It will be a trend that will go on for years. This trade will reflect what the whole world thinks of us &#8211; it will be boring. It will take a long time to play out and will simply grind lower for the coming years.

The strength of our dollar since 2008 has been the direct result of the Chinese commodity bubble. Now that it has popped, the Canadian dollar will gradually deflate to reflect this reality.

## Things that I am watching

**Central Fund of Canada**

I have mentioned that I believe that closed end precious metal ETFs offer a compelling alternative method for owning the metal.

In the past, when the bullishness in the precious metals market ran thick and Eric Sprott was a genius instead of a bum, the closed end ETFs actually traded at _premiums to NAV._ The silver ETF that Sprott launched actually reached a high of 34% premium to NAV in December of 2011. Ahhh, what a difference a couple of years make:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="PSLVNAVJan0813.gif" alt="PSLVNAVJan0813" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/PSLVNAVJan0813.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sprott Physical Silver Trust NAV with premium/discount on bottom panel</figcaption></figure> 

&nbsp;

The reasons for this premium were numerous, but let&#8217;s just say that the gold bug crowd did a good job of convincing (scaring) investors about the worries of confiscation or appropriation and that this ETF offered assurances that the physical metal would not be lent out and was outside the reach of the non-Canadian authorities.

Today I am not buying the Sprott ETFs, even though this premium to NAV has shrunk to basically zero, but instead focusing my energy on the Central Fund of Canada.

The Central Fund of Canada was the first closed end fund to invest solely in gold and silver. They were in the game long before Sprott and the other guys joined the party. In fact, they started in September of 1988 and have simply gone about quietly running a great business since then.

They have never engaged in any dilutive financings &#8211; all of the expansion has been done when the premium to NAV has allowed the financing to be accretive to existing holders even after all commissions have been taken into account. This generally means that when the premium goes above 8%, you can expect an issue.

The predictable nature of this company&#8217;s operation has resulted in a steady reliable way to invest in gold and silver.

The recent vicious bear market in precious metals, along with the advent of many competing products, has resulted in the Central Fund now trading at a discount to NAV. Â It has been trading around a 5% discount for the last few quarters:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="CEFNAVJan0814.gif" alt="CEFNAVJan0814" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/CEFNAVJan0814.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Central Fund of Canada NAV with premium/discount on bottom panel</figcaption></figure> 

This means that you can purchase gold and silver at a discount to existing prices. There can be no assurances that the discount won&#8217;t get wider, but at the very least, I don&#8217;t believe that these reputable business operators will dilute you with some stupid asset expanding corporate finance trick.

This is my preferred closed end ETF for long precious metal positions.

**Positions**

**New Position: Short Canadian dollar.** The USDCAD rate broke out to new highs yesterday and as I mentioned, I climbed aboard. Conviction level: 2. Stops to come.

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long various natural gas contracts.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather and I am tempted to lighten up. Conviction level: 4. No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long US treasury 5-30 year steepener and the 2-30 year steepener.** Conviction level: 3. I used to like this position a lot, but the action in the curve after the taper has got me worried. For now I am going to use 215 basis points on the 5-30 as my stop.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** Not the greatest trade so far, but I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. I have no long hedge on versus this position, but I am thinking about reinstating one into the recent weakness in the S&P 500. Conviction level: 3. No stop for now.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** I am long bond market volatility as I think the next crisis will start in the bond market. Conviction level: 3.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 6
