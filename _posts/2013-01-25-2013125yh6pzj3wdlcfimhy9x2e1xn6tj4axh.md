The big news out of Europe this morning is the announcement from the ECB about how much of the LTRO will be paid back by the 278 different financial institutions that made use of the emergency funding last year. &nbsp;Although officials are proclaiming the fact that 137.2 billion Euros will be returned as a sign that the European financial crisis has ceased, I am much less optimistic about this new development.

Europe, like all the other major developed nations, is suffering from a secular de-leveraging. &nbsp;It is made worse by the fact that the various nations that compromise the EU have tied their monetary policies together without having made the similar binds on the fiscal side and it is further complicated by the fact that they do not have true mobility of labour. &nbsp;A worker in California might pick up and move to North Dakota to take a job, but there are a lot less Spaniards picking up and moving to Germany. &nbsp;Europe has the double problem of the global de-leveraging which is made worse through the basic structural underpinnings of their monetary union. &nbsp;Therefore it is no surprise that when the global economy took a turn downward last summer, the problems were most acute in Europe.

The world is experiencing a massive secular private credit destruction cycle. &nbsp;This is the result of the bursting of the &#8216;super credit cycle&#8217;. &nbsp;This paying down of debt will be difficult to turn, as over the last few decades we have experienced a truly astounding rise in the amount of debt outstanding. &nbsp;In the absent of aggressive monetary or fiscal stimulus, the &#8216;natural&#8217; state of the economy will be one of credit contraction. &nbsp;The &#8216;super credit cycle&#8217; is the over arching theme that will dominate financial markets for years to come.

Many Central Banks have begun to realize this fact and we are seeing increasing use of the word &#8216;unlimited&#8217; when instituting monetary policies. &nbsp;The Swiss National Bank pegged their Franc to the Euro and promised &#8216;unlimited&#8217; intervention to maintain the peg. &nbsp;The Federal Reserve recently promised to buy $85 billion of different assets each month until the employment situation improved. &nbsp;Japan elected a new Prime Minister whose main platform was changing the BOJ policy to target higher inflation and ensuring that the target was met. &nbsp;These Central Bankers are realizing that the secular de-leveraging headwinds are quite formidable and will require aggressive balance sheet expansion. &nbsp;

Therefore I am quite concerned that the Euro-crats and the other ECB officials are proclaiming that the European economy is out of the woods much too early. &nbsp;We have experienced this easing up on the monetary gas pedal play out in past in both Japan and the US. &nbsp;With both of these nations, the moment that the QE programs ceased, asset prices sagged back down as deflation resumed.

I am also especially worried that given the aggressiveness of both the Fed and the BOJ, that the EU&#8217;s relative lack of money supply growth will cause the Euro currency to rise, thus putting the final nail in the coffin of any hope of a recovery in Europe.

Have a look at the EUR currency over the last little while:

You will notice that even though the European economy is actually performing much more poorly than the US economy, the EUR is rising. &nbsp;Why is that? &nbsp;Simple &#8211; the supply of Euros is not been expanded as quickly as are the supply of US dollars.

The problem is slightly more complicated than that, but let&#8217;s look at the ECB&#8217;s total balance sheet:


![](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/ECB%20Total%20BS%20Jan%2025%2013.gif) 

You will notice that in the last quarter the ECB&#8217;s total balance sheet has now started to decrease. &nbsp;

Let&#8217;s compare that to the Fed&#8217;s:


![](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/Fed%20Total%20BS%20Jan%2025%2013.gif) 

Almost the exact opposite. &nbsp;Whereas the ECB&#8217;s balance sheet is slightly contracting, the Fed has been expanding their balance sheet over this same time period. &nbsp;

So the ECB is busy reducing their balance sheet while at the same time the Federal Reserve is expanding their assets! &nbsp;It is no wonder the EUR is so strong.

**Given these policies, the ECB is in essence the tightest of the three major Central Banks. &nbsp;**

When we reach zero bound interest rates, the way to measure relative Central Bank tightness is to contrast the rate of asset expansion on the balance sheet. &nbsp;ECB is by far the tightest and is giving no signals that they are willing to change their tune. &nbsp;In fact, their &#8216;all clear on the financial crisis&#8217; signals are sending the exact opposite message. &nbsp;The ECB is way too hawkish and making a very big policy error.

How do we profit from this? &nbsp;&nbsp;

Although I have in previous posts discussed shorting OATs futures against Bunds, that trade is not going to be the most effective way to exploit this reality. &nbsp;Eventually that trade will work in spades, but you need to be patient.

A better trade for today might be to short European stocks. &nbsp;

Let&#8217;s go to the charts to examine that idea:


![](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/DAX%20Jan%2025%2013.gif) 

Whoa! &nbsp;That German DAX index is a good looking chart, maybe shorting that is not such a good idea. &nbsp;Let&#8217;s keep digging.


![](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/IBEX%20Jan%2025%2013.gif) 

That chart is not quite as good looking, but it is not showing any technical signs of weakness.

Maybe our favourite French market is not as strong?


![](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/CAC%20Jan%2025%2013.gif) 

No, surprisingly that is also looking good. &nbsp;In fact, if you take the whole European stocks market average using the Euro Stoxx 50, it is quite a positive chart:


![](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/EUROSTOX%20Jan%2025%2013.gif) 

I am not a trend follower by any means and in fact, more often than not, I have no problem &#8216;fighting&#8217; the market, but this doesn&#8217;t seem like the greatest point to stand in there and &#8216;fade&#8217; the rally. &nbsp;At least not yet.

I would almost rather wait for these indexes to roll over and sell them on signs of weakness.

But, I still think this trade is going to work, so how else can I institute it?

Well, have a look at the chart below:


![](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/STOXvsSPX%20Jan%2025%2013.gif) 

This is the spread ratio of the EuroStoxx 50 vs the S&P 500. &nbsp;You will notice that this chart is not nearly as &#8216;positive&#8217; looking. &nbsp;The European stocks have been badly under performing their US counterparts over the last year.

This is the kind of chart that is much easier to short. &nbsp;The intermediate trend is most obviously down and we have had a slight uptick over the last couple of weeks that allows us to establish our position at prices slightly off the lows.

Over the long term, the trend has actually been one of EuroStoxx strength versus US stocks:


![](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/STOXvsSPX%20LT%20Jan%2025%2013.gif) 

I believe that the new long term trend is down. &nbsp;I am a bull on America&#8217;s economy and a bear on the European one.

This trade works on both the short term technical time frame, and also coincides with my belief of the fundamentals. &nbsp;

I am establishing the trade today and will be making this one of my core positions. &nbsp;I will be shorting EuroStoxx 50 futures against equal amount of S&P500 futures. &nbsp;

The ECB simply doesn&#8217;t understand the new reality of the worldwide global de-leveraging and a massive under performance of their equity markets will be the result.
