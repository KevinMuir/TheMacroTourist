So far I have refrained from commenting on the BitCoin phenomenon. I didn&#8217;t want to be blasted with vicious attacks like the one that Max Keiser unleashed on blogger Joseph Weisenthal after he went on CNBC and claimed that maybe BitCoins were fundamentally worthless:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/12/MaxKeiserNov1413.png" alt="MaxKeiserNov1413" title="MaxKeiserNov1413.png" border="0" width="598" height="355" />

Wishing someone to blow their brains out on CNBC because you disagree with their position seems a little extreme, but hey, I am Canadian and things aren&#8217;t quite as black and white for us. 

Max Keiser must have been emboldened with the enormous amount of money is he is making with his bitcoin positions because he has taken to tweeting rather &#8220;certain&#8221; predictions about the future value of the soaring bitcoins versus the sagging price of silver:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/12/Max_Keiser__maxkeiser__on_Twitter-2.png" alt="Max Keiser maxkeiser on Twitter 2" title="Max_Keiser__maxkeiser__on_Twitter-2.png" border="0" width="600" height="200" />

As I mentioned in a previous post, I am not 100% sure of anything, least of all, the price of bitcoin. 

I do find it interesting what has happened to the price of BitCoin since Max has issued this proclamation:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/12/BitCoinDec0613.png" alt="BitCoinDec0613" title="BitCoinDec0613.png" border="0" width="600" height="350" />

Now I am not trying to pick on Max, I understand how difficult it is to put predictions down on paper for the whole world to see. I guess that is why I never present something as 100% certain to happen. Heck I am happy if I could shoot straight two thirds of the time.

What I am trying to point out is how emotional bitcoin has become. This is not a typical market, but rather represents a new almost religious experience.

Before the bitcoiniacs claim that I just don&#8217;t get it, let me tell you a little bit about my experience with bitcoins. One of my younger co-workers, someone with a lot more vision and intelligence than I, became interested in bitcoins over a year ago. After listening to him go on about the technical aspects of this new technology, I gave one of my arbitrary prejudiced old man &#8220;that&#8217;s the most cockamamie pile of crap I have ever heard&#8221; dismissals. Instead of rushing to judge, I wish I had listened and peeled off just $10 grand and bought some bitcoins. At that time they were only trading at $8 per BTC and at the highs last week, that $10k would have been worth $1.5 million. 

But I didn&#8217;t listen to him and it wasn&#8217;t until a few months ago that we once again started looking into bit coins as a new vehicle to trade. At the time, Bitcoin was trading at around $100. We did some work and decided that an investment in dedicated bitcoin mining machines seemed like a good bet, so we bought 8 machines and become bitcoin miners. 

Since then I have followed the market quite closely. I am not some Luddite that does not understand the truly revolutionary nature of the technology. I understand how ingenious the whole idea of a non-centralized electronic currency truly is.

Yet I am about to tell you why I think BitCoin is a bubble that cannot hold its value. But, this is an important distinction that I would like to make &#8211; do not confuse that as condemnation of the bit coin technology. I am not negative on BitCoin as a concept. I am highly sceptical about the _price of bitcoin._ 

As at the time of this writing, there are 12,092,075 bitcoins in existence. That means at the price when Max Keiser was 100% sure bitcoin would eclipse the market cap of all the silver in existence, the total value of the bit coins was over $14 billion dollars.

This $14 billion dollars of value has been created out of thin air. This might seem amazing, but it happens all the time. The market cap for electric car maker Telsa is over $16 billion. Although some of the Tesla bulls might argue that Tesla is a good long term bet, there is no doubt in my mind that Tesla has rallied to this valuation because it is so difficult to price the true fundamental long term value of Telsa&#8217;s future earnings, therefore the short term price action has overwhelmed the price determination inputs. It is simply going up because it is going up. This is the reflexive nature of financial markets that Soros highlights. At increasingly price levels, the total demand increases, not decreases as would be expected. This creates a bubble that takes the financial asset far, far away from its true fundamental value.

Which brings us back to bitcoin. To argue it has not become a little bit of a modern speculative Pets.com is just naive. However, although the vast majority of 1990s Dotcom bubble stocks went bankrupt, there were some winners that now are trillion dollar businesses. What is to say that BitCoin is not the next Amazon instead of Pets.com?

Bitcoin has been called an electronic gold. And to a large degree, I completely agree. Just like gold, Bitcoin is _nobody&#8217;s liability_. This is it&#8217;s single greatest attribute. There is no central clearing house or government that is in charge of regulating or creating bitcoins. In this day and age of irresponsible government policies, having an asset that is nobody&#8217;s liability is worth something.

But how much?

Just a couple of months ago, when Bitcoin was _only $200,_ a report from a famous &#8220;made a gazillion dollars at thirty years old and now I have retired to just trade my money&#8221; hedge fund manager circulated that said that either bitcoin was worth zero, or it was worth $10,000. Therefore, on the off chance that it did work, the risk reward favoured buying bitcoin at $200. His main argument was to compare the extra premium that gold trades at due its unique nature of being no one&#8217;s liability and also store of value, and then apply that to bitcoin. With that analysis, he reckoned that if bitcoin became an &#8220;electronic gold&#8221;, the price should be $10,000 per coin.

Before we go any further, let me tell you about how much I think this report influenced the price of bitcoin. This hedge fund manager who wrote this report is very well respected in the hedge fund community. When he wrote this report, the other hedge fund managers would have taken note. And if there is something that I have learned, it is that they hate to have other hedge fund managers nail a trade without them being involved. I have a good buddy who used to work in Connecticut for a famous hedge fund, but has now moved back to the Great White North for a more sedate lifestyle. But he keeps in touch with his trading buddies, and they are all putting gobs of money into this biotech investment. The other day he explained to me that he basically couldn&#8217;t live with himself if they hit it big without him also being invested. So therefore even though he basically thought it was a high risk trade that he wouldn&#8217;t have taken on his own, the cost of not being invested was greater than the cost of losing his entire investment. I know it sounds perverse, but I completely understand where he is coming from.

And this is what I think happened with bitcoin. Once it became fashionable to take a punt on bitcoin, all of these hedge fund managers bought some for their personal accounts. Here is what I think is the typical attitude of these hedge fund managers:

> “Put a little money in Bitcoin,” Novogratz, principal and co-chief investment officer of macro funds at Fortress, said at a conference held today in New York by UBS AG’s chief investment office. “Come back in a few years and it’s going to be worth a lot.” 

They are willing to gamble because if they are right, the upside does seem quite limitless.

And the reason it is limitless is because Joseph Weisenthal was correct in his assessment that bitcoin was fundamentally valueless. If something has no fundamental value, what&#8217;s to stop it from trading at a truly outrageous price?

Bitcoins are not backed by a government with the ability to tax its citizens. It does not earn anything as there is no interest paid on this security (which as an aside, I wonder if the bitcoin craze would have ever even begun if the world wasn&#8217;t filled with Zero Interest Rate Policies). There is really nothing going for it apart from the fact that if everyone accepts it as an alternative currency, then it is worth so much more.

So if you are buying bitcoin today, you are in essence wagering on its ability to become a new alternative currency. 

I could go on about the logistic problems with bitcoins. How it takes 10 minutes for a transaction to propagate throughout the network. (How is that ever going to work for transactions like buying coffee?) How if you lose your electronic wallet (or it becomes corrupted) you are completely screwed &#8211; which is much like cash, but most people don&#8217;t hold any significant part of their net worth in cash. How there is an infinitely small chance that a person (or group of people) were able to take control of the bitcoin network, then they could take your bitcoins away (this is very unlikely and more theoretical than actually a legitimate risk, but the risk isn&#8217;t zero and I ask you again, how much of your net worth would you trust to something that could be overrun?) 

And let me tell you about the mechanics of my actual purchases of bitcoins. When I finally got around to trying out bitcoin, I expected my prejudices to be eliminated once I actually used the product. However, as I went through the process of actually transacting in bitcoin, I became even more skeptical. This technology is far from user friendly.

But, the bitcoiniacs will say &#8211; &#8220;wait, it is about to get a lot better.&#8221;

Which I agree with completely. But here in lies the greatest weakness to bitcoin.

**The most persuasive argument for bitcoins is that the supply is limited.** There can be no Central Banker that arbitrarily decides to quadruple the money supply overnight. The amount of bitcoins has been set by the algorithm and that is not going to change.

However, this is point that I think most bitcoin bulls are missing. There is indeed a _limited supply of bitcoins, **however, there is an unlimited supply of crypto currencies.**_

There is nothing stopping another crypto currency was springing up and replacing bitcoin. There is no magic technology that makes the bitcoin unreproduceable.

In fact, the current second most popular crypto currency, lite coin, was created with much of the same technology that bitcoin uses, only it was improved upon.

The actual barriers to entry for crypto currencies are actually quite small. The only real impediment is reaching a critical mass. 

Given that bitcoin is the first iteration of this technology, do you really think it is wise to assume that no one is going to improve on it?

That there is no way someone is going to come up with something better?

And that the supply is really as limited as the bulls will make you believe?

**I would argue that the supply is actually infinite and that even though crypto currencies are probably here to stay, the chances that bitcoin being the one that wins is probably quite small.**

If the supply of crypto currencies is actually infinite, does bitcoin really deserve to have a $14 billion dollar market capitalization?

The many benefits of bitcoin do not require a massive market capitalization. The electronic transactions can still be executed with the price of bitcoin being $100 or even $1. There is no need for the price of bitcoin to be rocketing higher for the alternative currency to be viable.

I would argue that there is a good chance that this is yet another bubble, fuelled by investors&#8217; desire to somehow find alternative sources of maintaining their purchasing power in this age of ZIRP and QE programs from the major Western Central Banks.

When you combine the massively irresponsible monetary policies with the technological advances we are making, it makes perfect sense that an electronic currency is the narrative that captures the public&#8217;s imagination. 

However, think long and hard about what you are buying when you are &#8220;investing&#8221; in bitcoins. It is merely an address in an network that some technology geeks have decided to create. It is only worth what we all collectively say it is worth. And yes, if you think that bitcoins are going to replace the US dollar, then by all means, go out and get long. But before you do, I would suggest you go out and try using the product. Then, think about the problems with the product, and what is stopping the next bitcoin from improving on those problems. And then finally, if there is going to be another bitcoin, do any of the arguments about the limited supply make any sense whatsoever? 

And if that isn&#8217;t scary enough, I will leave you with this little tidbit. There are reports that the infamous Winklevoss twins who claimed part ownership of Facebook now own 1% of all the bitcoins in existence. 

> An array of speculators have now bid up the price of the bitcoin to the point where the outstanding supply of the digital money was worth $1.3 billion at last count. The Winklevii — as they are popularly known — say they own nearly 1 percent of that, or some $11 million.
> 
> The 6-foot-5 Winklevii were unfazed by the latest tumult. Indeed, the brothers said they used the low prices to buy more. They argue that bitcoin will have much further to soar once a broader audience sees its virtues: a unit of exchange that can be moved around the world at the click of a button without requiring any payments to Western Union or American Express.
> 
> “People say it’s a Ponzi scheme, it’s a bubble,” said Cameron Winklevoss. “People really don’t want to take it seriously. At some point that narrative will shift to ‘virtual currencies are here to stay.’ We’re in the early days.”
> 
> The brothers began dabbling in bitcoin last summer when the dollar value of a single coin was still in the single digits. In addition to the purchase of bitcoins, they also say they have invested in a bitcoin-related company, but declined to disclose which one. The currency itself exists as a string of letters and numbers. In order to keep their holdings secure from hackers, they have taken those codes off networked computers and saved them on small flash drives. They said they have put the drives in safe deposit boxes at banks in three different cities.

If you are buying bitcoin today, think about the company you are keeping. 

The rally over the last few months has been truly remarkable. It has made hundred of millions of dollars for an elite few out of thin air.

People like Max Keiser, the Winklevii and many hedge fund managers have completely nailed this trade and made hundreds of millions of dollars for themselves. However, to me, this doesn&#8217;t look any different than a bunch of other momentum based bubbles that will ultimately end in tears. I am no Max Keiser, so I can&#8217;t tell you with 100% accuracy, but I am willing to say that a year from now, bit coin will be significantly lower than where we are today. I am 66% certain!
