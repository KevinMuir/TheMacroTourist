One of the things that never seems to amaze me is how quickly everyone&#8217;s attitude change as market prices change.

My latest head shaking observation is how everyone has abandoned the whole &#8216;**the Fed is going to cause hyperinflation**&#8216; theory.  It was only a few short months ago that market participants were falling all over themselves to short US dollars, buy gold and other all &#8216;real assets&#8217; because the Fed was about to embark on a massive Quantitative Easing program that would usher in the next era of inflation.

Well guess what?  The Fed did embark on a massive $85 billion a month open ended Quantitative Easing program.  They did exactly what everyone feared.  The Fed followed through in spades.

And guess what else?  The US dollar did not sell off.  Commodities did not rally.  In fact, just the opposite happened.

Since the Fed&#8217;s QE Infinity program has been announced, financial assets have rallied and &#8216;real assets&#8217; have gotten decimated.

Have a look at the S&P 500 versus gold over the last 6 months:

So today, even though the Fed is printing $85 trillion of new money every month, due to the fact that the price action has embarrassed many market forecasters, my inbox is filled with all sorts of &#8216;**the end of the era of real assets**&#8216; research.

Could this be in fact be the end of the era of real assets?  Sure &#8211; the terrible price action of grains, gold, copper and other &#8216;real assets&#8217; might in fact be signalling a forthcoming large sell off.

However, let me leave you with something to think about.  **If that is indeed the case, that will mean that we are about to experience declining inflation all the while we have increasing financial asset prices such as the S&P 500.  Bernanke & Co. will have achieved a near perfect nirvana of being able to inflate only beneficial financial assets while keeping non-beneficial (at least in terms of their price rising ) &#8216;real assets&#8217; low.**  I am not nearly as confident that the Fed will be able to achieve this outcome.  And I am especially not going to allow the price action over the last few months to sway me from my thinking.  There are plenty of times that markets get things very wrong.  I am not saying this is &#8216;for sure&#8217; going to be one of those times, but I am hesitant to climb aboard the &#8216;**sell real assets &#8211; buy financial ones**&#8216; trade just because it has worked for the last little while.  Too much of the popularity of this trade is based on simple extrapolation of recent trends.  The analysis that the Fed&#8217;s QE program will eventually cause inflation is just as valid today as it was on the day the Fed announced it.  Don&#8217;t let price action be the arbitrator of your positions.
