I have written in the past about my deep founded respect for Jeremy Grantham and the team at GMO. Unfortunately they don’t deal with individuals (apart from really high net worth individuals outside my snack bracket). I really wish they did, as if anything every happened to me, GMO is one of the few firms I would be happy to have manage my family’s assets.

What I like about GMO is that they are not afraid to buck the trend and suffer through periods of under performance. I firmly believe that there are times that the market becomes a self reinforcing feedback loop. During these periods, the market goes up simply because it has been going up. Although investing at these times might lead to profitable monthly, quarterly or even sometimes, yearly performance &#8211; over the long haul, investing at these points is a losing strategy. The only difficult part is sitting through the period where everyone around you is getting “rich” and you look like a fool for not joining in. GMO has no problem doing so, and for that, they have my undying admiration.

I watch GMO’s commentaries quite closely and as a trader I recognize that they are often early. However I do watch for extremes in what they believe is fair value and what the market is pricing.

We are currently experiencing one of those “extreme” events where according to GMO’s models there are two asset classes that have significantly diverged.

During the last year, US small cap equities have exploded higher as investors have flooded into the US market. At the same time, the mini-crises that we have experienced in various Emerging Markets has caused a flight out of that asset class.

This has created a situation where GMO’s models are forecasting significant negative real returns for US small caps and just the opposite for Emerging Markets.

I am not pulling the trigger on this trade by any means. Right now we are in the midst of the self reinforcing feedback loop, and as a trader, all there is to be done is to acknowledge this reality. But I am going to be watching these two assets closely. I have no doubt that GMO is going to be correct in that over the next 7 years &#8211; the real return of the Emerging Markets is going to outperform the US small caps. The EEM is priced for continued disaster and the IWM is priced for continued perfection. The markets will eventually revert to a more normalized pricing. 

But eventually is a long time. Jeremy Grantham likes to tell the story about how his firm avoided the Dot Com bubble debacle and over that decade had one of the highest sharp ratios in the business. However when he examined how many actually dollars he had taken out of the market, it was not nearly as high as he expected because many of his clients reduced their exposure to his firm during the period of underperformance. His clients had all taken the money away from him at the precise moment they should have been giving him more! 

It is very difficult to sit through these periods of underperformance, but as a trader, I have the luxury of not been involved. For now I am going to simply sit on the sidelines and wait for some signs that the market is starting to agree with GMO&#8217;s models. Rest assured though that there will be a day where I will wander into this trade and join GMO by buying EEM and selling IWM with both fists.

**Things that I am watching**
  
Japanese Yen vs. equities

Over the last couple of years, the Japanese Yen&#8217;s weakness has been tracking (or leading) the movement in the US and Japanese equities. However, recently the US equity market has diverged from the Yen:

The Nikkei has not diverged as much:

</div>

Has the US equity market finally broken free of the blind tick for tick tracking of the Yen? Or is this an opportunity to short US equities and short Yen (buy USDJPY)? I am not sure, but it is an interesting development that bears close watching.

**Positions**

**Short US 5 Year Treasury Futures.  **I expect the Fed to continue to withdraw stimulus aggressively.  Conviction 3

**Short US 2 Year Treasury Futures.  **I think the downside is a move from 31 bps to 25 while the upside is a move up to 50 bps.  Conviction 4

**Short Euro.  **Added to this trade into the recent rally.   Conviction 5

<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Short Nasdaq 100 futures, short Eurostoxx futures, and short Nikkei futures.  </strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I entered the trade last Wednesday with idea that the Fed is going to taper until something breaks and that the bulls are pushing their luck.  Conviction 4.  No stops for now</span>

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index vs Long S&P 500.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities.   Conviction 5

<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Short Yen. </strong></strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> Establish short Yen last week.  Now I will sit tight and wait.  Conviction 4</span>

**Short JGB futures.  **I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.
