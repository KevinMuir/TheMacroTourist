In the summer of 1987, one of the greatest bond trading investment firms of all time, Soloman Brothers, fired their entire money market staff. Why would you need to trade short term money market paper when there was exciting stock index arbitrage to conduct? 

A few months later when the stock market crash descended upon Wall Street, clients rushed into short term money market instruments and this division was one of the few profitable areas for all the other dealers that had not dismantled their desks. I guess it also helped that there was one less big competitor out there as well.

When I read about Deutsche Bank&#8217;s recent decision to exit the commodity business, this ill timed exit by Saloman Brothers immediately jumped into my mind. According to the FT:

> The bank will wind down trading in energy, agriculture, base metals and dry bulk over the next two years and will cut around 200 jobs worldwide as a result of the move. 

For contrarians such as myself, this is a great sign. The pessimism about commodities is quite thick. According to George Stein, managing director of New York-based recruiting firm Commodity Talent LLC;

> &#8220;The destruction of the commodities business at Deutsche Bank is one more sign that the large global banks no longer see commodities as viable,&#8221; Stein added.

I guess it is not surprising, a quick look at the chart of the CRB index shows why DB is shutting up shop:

Commodities have been dead money, with a steady drift lower. 

Yet all the while, stocks are doing this:

I am sure that the DB decision is a well thought out strategic decision that does not merely reflect chasing the hot asset at the top all the while abandoning the out of favour asset class. No way that this is anything like Saloman Brothers&#8217; terribly timed decision&#8230;
