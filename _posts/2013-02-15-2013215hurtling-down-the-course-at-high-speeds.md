My seven year old son loves to play this race car game on his X-Box.  Lately whenever I get home from work I have to race him in an epic head to head battle.  Although I am trying to get him to choose some more refined cars (I am partial to the classic Ferrari California that Ferris Bueller drove), inevitably he wants to choose his favourite &#8211; a Buggati Veyron.  His strategy consists of choosing the fastest production car ever made, squeezing on the accelerator as tight as he can and flinging his car down the track full speed, bouncing off every wall along the way.

Lately, I feel like he might be skipping school and instead be doing a little consulting work for various Central Banks.

As economic growth has continued to prove exceedingly elusive, combined with the fact that the real debt burden is continuing to grow, more and more Central Banks are simply throwing caution to the wind, choosing the fastest car and squeezing the accelerator.  The amount of stimulus that is going into the system is truly mind blowing.  There was a time when adding $85 billion to the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet every month would have seemed inconceivable.  Now the market sees it as the bare minimum to keep the system aloft.  There was a time when a Japanese Government Minister would have had to commit Hara-kiri for suggesting the government is targeting Nikkei price levels.  Now it is just a regular day in Japan.  There was a time when the Swiss people would have risen up in revolution against a government that engaged in unlimited money printing.  Now it is accepted as a necessary evil.

The world is a much different place.  But we all know that.

However, the point I am making is the rate of change is increasing.

Central Banks are increasingly having less patience.  They are doing more without waiting for results.  Governments are increasingly actively devaluing their currency without worry for the geo-political consequences.  They are putting their own people&#8217;s needs first.

I recently came across this great chart of the stages of a de-leveraging:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/a9fccefc0ee8c4d1822096cf68ddfd53.png" />

The author put a small arrow at the point of the cycle where we thinks we are in the de-leveraging process.

I would contend that we are past the &#8216;Weakness in Pricing Power&#8217; and are firmly in the &#8216;Devaluation&#8217; stage.  We see this with Japan&#8217;s aggressive policy.  Or with the SNB&#8217;s pegging of the Swiss Franc.

If you have noticed, the slope of the curve increases to the downside once you get through &#8216;Weakness in Pricing Power&#8217;.

This confirms my feelings that the situation is changing rapidly.  We have hit the point in musical chairs where the music has been running for some time and you know it is about to stop any second.

During the coming years we are going to have some dramatic economic and financial market changes that will be very difficult for most people to navigate.

You need to remember that the Central Bankers are like my son in a straight away with his Bugatti Veyron doing 200 mph and the pedal still straight to the floor.  You know a turn is coming and there will be no way he can make it, but he still doesn&#8217;t let up on the gas.  He inevitably crashes his car &#8211; it happens every time.
