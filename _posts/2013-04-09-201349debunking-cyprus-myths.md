Lately I have been reading a lot of differing research about the ramifications of the Cyprus crisis.  Many of the comments seem to center around the idea that, as usual, the markets over reacted and that the tiny little nation of Cyprus does not matter.  This idea seems to be gaining more and more traction as the markets go higher, which is unusual because the financial pundits are usually so good at coming up with sound fundamental reasons for their opinions as opposed to simply reflecting the price action over the last week.  Apart from the parrots who keep squawking about Cyprus not mattering because stocks are rising, there is another camp who I will call the &#8216;I will find inflation everywhere&#8217; camp who have somehow concluded that the failure of the government to protect the bank deposits will result in more cash being withdrawn and usher in the next hyper inflationary wave.  I think that most of the analysis about the Cyprus situation is just plain wrong and here&#8217;s why:

**Myth Number 1:  Cyprus does not matter because the financial markets have since headed higher.**  Really?  If you follow that line of reasoning to its full conclusion there is no reason to ever do analysis because markets are always perfectly efficient.  It reminds me of the old joke about two economists walking down the street.  One of the economists spots a hundred dollar bill lying on the ground and starts to bend down to pick it up.  The other economist says to him, &#8220;don&#8217;t bother &#8211; if it was real someone would have already picked it up.&#8221;  The idea that you can look at price action to determine the ramifications of any long term fundamental change is absurd.  We have seen time and time again markets get big picture stuff wrong for extended periods of time.  If you think that using price action is a valid analysis tool for anything but risk control, then you and I have a fundamental disagreement about the way markets work.  I am not saying that I am never wrong as you will see notice that I get run over by the market on a fairly consistent basis.  However, the market can also get it wrong and price action is no tool for serious analysis.  When Keynes said that the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, he understood that market prices can be dramatically mis-priced versus fundamentals.  Keynes probably forget more about the markets than I will ever know, so I take heart in his implicit acknowledgement that prices are not perfect.

**Myth Number 2:  The Cyprus crisis will cause Europeans to take money out of bank accounts and in doing so, they will spend it and kick start a hyper inflation.  **This is a new theory being touted by the inflationista camp.  I recently heard a very respected Canadian gold fund manager advance this popular theory on an interview on KingWorldNews.  I had to do everything I could to not turn it off after listening to him tout this idea.  Turning bank deposits into cash is DEFLATIONARY!   Especially when the public is taking their deposits and saving them for fear of it being confiscated.  This money that is coming out of banks is being stuffed under mattresses.

This causes banks to be less able to make loans, it makes the economic system grind to a halt.  It does absolutely nothing to kick start a hyper inflationary surge like these managers are suggesting.

**Myth Number 3:  Taking money from private sector bank accounts to pay for the crisis is not that big a deal and people will soon forget.  **When I was growing up we used to go the cottage each week-end.  On the return from the cottage one Sunday night we noticed something was amiss with our house.  Upon entry we quickly realized that we have been robbed.  Not only that, the thieves had completely ransacked the place.  Although I do remember this event very clearly, it is a conversation that I had with my father a couple of decades later that really sticks in my head.  My father admitted that he had kept up a brave face in front of us, but that he was shocked at how much this violation and theft had affected him.  I think we all live with these assumptions about how our society operates and when these assumptions are proven false, it is very difficult to deal with.  After our robbery, my Dad forever installed alarms and made elaborate automation systems to make it look like we were always home.  He was never really the same when it came to trusting that he wouldn&#8217;t be robbed again.  For those pundits who think that the Cyprus people will soon forgive and forget, they are foolish.  These people have just been lied to and for generations will never trust the government again.  The idea that this will be contained to just Cyprus is also very naive.  The European people might be fond of their bureaucracies  but they are not idiots.  They see the writing on the wall.  The way that the Eurocrats handled the Cyprus crisis might very well go down and the single most stupid thing they have done to date (and that is saying a lot because they have managed to do a lot of stupid things).
