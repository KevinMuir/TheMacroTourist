I have been accumulating a long position in the closed end fund of Uranium Participation Corp (U CN Equity) over the last few months.  The fund&#8217;s sole purpose is to hold Uranium.

I am bullish on Uranium for a variety of different reasons, but the catalyst for aggressively adding to the position is that there has been a couple of recent developments that have dramatically improved the bullish story.

Recently there was an under reported problem in Africa that is significantly effecting the supply side of the uranium equation.  Casey Daily Dispatch had a great summary of the event and its ramifications:

> By Marin Katusa

> Last week, suicide bombers launched attacks on two different towns in the West African nation of Niger – one on a military barracks in Agadez, and the other one on the Somair uranium mine in Arlit, owned by the French conglomerate AREVA. The jihadist group MUJAO (Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa) has claimed responsibility for both bombings, stating that they were targeting &#8220;the enemies of Islam in Niger.&#8221;

> The assault on the uranium mine left one dead and 14 injured, and was successful in damaging the crushing and grinding units, halting the mine&#8217;s production. The importance of this mine in the uranium sector cannot be understated: it accounts for roughly 5% of the global output and more than 20% of AREVA&#8217;s total production. The Somair mine is a key source of supply for France&#8217;s 58 nuclear reactors which, in turn, provide more than _75% of the electricity generated in France_.

Any time that 5% of the global output is taken off the market, I sit up and notice.  That is a big number to take offline.

On the demand side, there was also another bullish development.

There has been some concerns that Japanese Prime Minister Abe would be unable to follow through with the restarting of the nuclear plants due to their unpopularity with the Japanese public.  Abe recently reaffirmed that he would be following through with his campaign promise to restart the plants (from the NY Times):

> In a speech to Parliament, Mr. Abe pledged to restart nuclear plants that pass the tougher guidelines, which are expected to be adopted by a new independent watchdog agency, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, as early as July. He did not specify when any of the reactors might resume operation, and news reports have suggested that it might take months or even years to make the expensive upgrades needed to meet the new safety standards.

> Still, by making the promise in front of the Diet, Mr. Abe indicated in the strongest way yet that he planned to move ahead with a campaign pledge to reverse his predecessor’s hopes that Japan would begin weaning itself off [nuclear energy](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/atomic-energy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier).

Abe correctly recognizes that his country&#8217;s fiscal situation is extremely precarious and importing any more fossil fuels for energy demands than is absolutely necessary is only a recipe for disaster.  Japan needs nuclear energy, even though the Japanese public doesn&#8217;t want it restarted, they cannot afford not to.

From a price perspective, the Uranium Participation Fund has had a good move off the lows and is now consolidating while drifting slightly lower.  This is exactly the kind of action that I like to accumulate long term positions.

And equally importantly, the discount/premium to NAV is not shooting up and is hovering around a 8.5% discount, offering decent value against the underlying assets.

I am long U and will only be buying more on weakness.
