Yesterday at their regularly scheduled meeting, the ECB left rates unchanged as expected, but Mario Draghi took a page from Bernanke&#8217;s book and attempted to further cement their accommodative policy through the increase use of forward guidance. From Bloomberg:

> Draghi said the use of “firmer words” in his opening statement today “reiterates our decisiveness to act if needed.” The phrase “strongly emphasizes” wasn’t used in last month’s communique, and other new language include a “firm” reiteration of the ECB’s forward guidance.

Although right now the European economy is growing, albeit in a lacklustre fashion, the financial markets are enthusiastically bidding up the price of most European risk assets. Yet Europe still faces major structural headwinds, and most importantly, these problems are occurring while the ECB runs a monetary policy that is much tighter than their two major competitors.

During the European credit crisis of a couple of years ago, the ECB saved the day with a massive LTRO (long term repo operation) that expanded their balance sheet and arrested the financial contagion. However, as the crisis subsided, the ECB gradually allowed these assets to mature without renewing them and in the process shrunk the ECB balance sheet.

Over the last year as the ECB was allowing its balance sheet contract, the Fed and BoJ have engaged in two of the biggest Central Bank balance sheets expansions ever seen.

Here is a chart of the ECB balance sheet versus the Federal Reserve over the last few years:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="ECBvsUSFedJan0914.gif" alt="ECBvsUSFedJan0914" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/ECBvsUSFedJan0914.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">ECB Total Balance sheet (white line) vs Fed&#8217;s Total Balance sheet (yellow line)</figcaption></figure> 

You will notice that at the start of the 2008 credit crisis both Central Banks aggressively expanded their balance sheets. They were roughly in sync until 2011 when the ECB spiked their balance sheet due to the European sovereign debt crisis. Since that crisis subsided, they have allowed their total assets to shrink, all the while the Fed has actively increased their balance sheet with QE3. The ECB&#8217;s balance sheet is well off its high value, while the US Fed&#8217;s balance sheet is ticking at new highs every day.

The chart of the BoJ balance sheet versus the ECB is a little bit different in terms of timing, but the trend is the same:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="ECBvsBoJjan0914.gif" alt="ECBvsBoJjan0914" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/ECBvsBoJjan0914.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">ECB&#8217;s Total Balance sheet (white line) vs Bank of Japan&#8217;s Total Balance Sheet (yellow line)</figcaption></figure> 

The Bank of Japan did not engage in a massive expansion at the onset of the 2008 credit crisis. Leading up to that crisis, they had even allowed their balance sheet to contract.

This lack of expansion caused all sorts of problems for the Bank of Japan. The Yen was extremely strong, deflation was persistent and their economy limped along in a zombie like trance. Finally after the horrible tsunami tragedy, the Japanaese people elected Prime Minster Abe who ushered in a new era of extremely aggressive monetary policy. Since then though, the BoJ&#8217;s balance sheet has been shooting straight up to the moon. Again this massive expansion is occurring during a period where the ECB is allowing their balance sheet to shrink.

This has had an absolutely stunning effect on the two currencies. Have a look at the EURJPY cross rate:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="EURJPYJan0914.gif" alt="EURJPYJan0914" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/EURJPYJan0914.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">EURJPY cross rate (higher price means higher Euro / lower Yen)</figcaption></figure> 

**The EURJPY rate has moved from 95 to 145 in a little over a year and a half.** Although you could argue it should have never been 95 in the first place, the sheer pace of this move has to be incredibly difficult for the European exporters to deal with. This sort of devaluation just doesn&#8217;t happen in large economics and the ECB is being naive about their economy&#8217;s ability to handle it.

In yesterday&#8217;s press conference, Draghi spoke about the comparisons of the ECB to Japan. I pulled the transcript and something that I found fascinating was that the **reporter did not ask about Japan. Draghi chose to speak about it:**

> Question: Mr President, you have given us an account of the effectivity of the measures being taken within this crisis. Could you please also give us an outlook and your account of where you see the main risks in the forthcoming months that could undermine this effectivity? And secondly, just to clarify: in the last months, you have always told us that the ECB Governing Council currently sees no deflationary pressures. Now we see a rather negative outlook for the coming months. Is this still the stance the ECB Governing Council has?

> Answer: ..But we asked ourselves – and perhaps I have explained this on another occasion – are we close to the Japanese scenario? And the answer we gave ourselves is no, we are not. For a variety of reasons. The first one of which is the most important, i.e. that the ECB has taken decisive action at a very early stage of this crisis. The second is that the condition of the balance sheets of the banking sector and the corporate sector is not as bad as it was in the 1990s there. The third reason is that we are now proceeding fast with the asset quality review (AQR), which will lead to the repair of our banking system. And the final reason is that if we look back at how long-term inflation expectations were actually behaving in Japan at that time, we would find out that they were actually not firmly anchored. That is why it is so important that our inflation expectations remain firmly anchored, because they tell people that in a certain amount of time, over the medium term, inflation will go back to our objective, namely close to but below 2%.

Obviously the comparisons to Japan are weighing on Draghi&#8217;s mind. Yes, the reporter asked about deflation, but he did not mention Japan at all.

So there must be some realization that there is a chance that the EU is repeating the Japanese mistake.

Draghi has all sorts of reasons why they are not Japan, and no doubt they all have some validity.

However, the fact that the EU is dealing with the lowest inflation rate of all the major countries, along with the strongest currency, throws cold water in the face of the idea that they are not making the exact same mistakes that Japan made.

The strength of the Euro and the persistent low inflation are clear signs that their monetary policy is significantly tighter than their major economy competitors.

Now if you want to argue that deflation and a strong currency are not necessarily bad things, then I am fine with that argument. But make no mistake about it, that is the road that the Europeans are headed down. And if that is indeed the case, then all the European stock bulls are falling for the same siren song that the Japan bulls did before Prime Minister Abe&#8217;s new policies. Prior to the massive monetary expansion, many strategists would look at the relative cheapness of Japanese stocks and argue that they were a screaming buy. However, as the Bank of Japan stayed relatively tight, and deflation persisted, the Yen would rally and the stocks would just get cheaper.

The ECB better wake up to the fact that the Bank of Japan is going to go inflate or die trying. And neither is the Fed going to all of a sudden gets some sort of tight monetary religion. The Federal Reserve is scared to death of allowing their balance sheet to shrink due to the failed attempts to wean their economy off the QE1 and QE2 programs. The ECB is the only major Central Bank that is not willing to engage in competitive QE.

**Therefore, the ECB is going to find that they import everyone&#8217;s deflation.**

Maybe eventually we will get another European financial crisis and the ECB will once again join the other Central Banks in their irresponsible monetary ways. But the fact that European stocks and other risk assets are roaring higher means that this day is many quarters away.

The ECB is the tightest Central Bank, and although Draghi is attempting to talk a good game with his forward rate guidance, that is just talk. I remember that at a previous meeting the market (and myself included) got all excited because the minutes revealed that the ECB had discussed the logistics of negative interest rates. The Euro went down for one day until they once again realized that it was nothing more than talk. I fell for the idea that maybe the ECB &#8220;got it&#8221; in terms of the relative tightness of their policies, but actions mean so much more than words. The BoJ and the Fed are following through with actions &#8211; the ECB is just mouthing some words. I for one am not going to fall for their dovish talk.

Sometimes dovish talk is enough, but with the Fed and BoJ each printing about $75 billion each month, that is going to overwhelm any moral suasion that the ECB President thinks he can muster.

I am short European stocks and although the trade is not working, I view this rally very much like the many Japanese stock rallies over the last decade that raised everyone&#8217;s hopes, yet ultimately failed. Draghi tells me that Europe is not Japan, but his insistence sounds like he doth protest too much&#8230;

**Things I am watching**

Hudbay Minerals&#8217; successful bought deal financing.

Over the last year there has been a few rallies in the resource market where issuers have attempted to take advantage of the strength and sell some equity. It seemed like every time the dealer community stuck its neck out and did a bought deal the market punished them by immediately pushing the deal below the issue price.

Therefore it is with great interest that I note that yesterday Hudbay Minerals did a bought deal financing, that not only held issue price, but even closed up versus the deal price!<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="HBMJan1014.gif" alt="HBMJan1014" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/HBMJan1014.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Hudbay Minerals IntraDay chart for January 9th, 2014 after bought deal issue at $8.25</figcaption></figure> 

The company sold 18.2M share at $8.25 and although the price kissed that level first thing in the morning, it was a pretty steady chug higher for the rest of the day.

Could this be a change in sentiment for the resource sector? If so, expect a _ton of financings_ as issuers have basically been shut out of the financial markets for the last year.

**Positions**

**Short Canadian dollar.** CAD continues to quietly sink.  Conviction level: 4. Stops to come.

**Long various natural gas contracts UPDATE.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather. Conviction level: 3 No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** Not the greatest trade so far, but I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. I have no long hedge on versus this position, but I am thinking about reinstating one into the recent weakness in the S&P 500. Conviction level: 3. No stop for now.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** I am long bond market volatility as I think the next crisis will start in the bond market. Conviction level: 3.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 6
