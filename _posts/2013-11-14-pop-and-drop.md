Last night after the market closed, Fed Chairman (Chairperson?) in waiting Yellen signalled that she was going to continue on in with her predecessor&#8217;s QE programs and showed no signs of tapering any time soon. Although the market had worried that she was going to lean a little more hawkish to get through the nomination process, there really should have been no surprise as the Fed&#8217;s mandated policy goals are continuing to fall short of expectations (inflation and growth). This quote from Yellen&#8217;s testimony best sums it up:

> &#8220;We have made good progress, but we have farther to go to regain the ground lost in the crisis and the recession. Unemployment is down from a peak of 10 percent, but at 7.3 percent in October, it is still too high, reflecting a labour market and economy performing far short of their potential. At the same time, inflation has been running below the Federal Reserve&#8217;s goal of 2 percent and is expected to continue to do so for some time.&#8221;

The bond, gold and currency markets all rocketed higher on the release of this testimony. The stock market probably would have exploded higher as well, but it had already rallied hard all day and was digesting the terrible news out of tech bellwether Cisco. 

Nevertheless, the stock market closed at an all time high yesterday and it seems that the bullish brigade is feeling particularly invincible lately.

However, I want to remind you that tops are often made at emotional moments like this.

Remember the ECB rate cut? Think back to just a week ago and how bulled up everyone was at that announcement. But what has the European stock market done since then?

You can see the spike higher at the left of the chart. Those highs were fleeting at best, and we have drifted lower since then.

How about the September 2013 &#8220;no taper&#8221; explosion higher in the US?

You can see that after the initial reaction higher, the market proceeded to drift lower for a whole month.

It is difficult to sell when everyone else around you is buying (and coining money). But often this is the best time.

Last night was a break out to new highs.

Although fading strength is a dangerous proposition, I am willing to hang on and short a little more into the rally as I think there is a decent chance we are going to experience a &#8220;pop and drop.&#8221;

Remember to take advantage of the low vols in the stock market and put on bearish trades through options.
