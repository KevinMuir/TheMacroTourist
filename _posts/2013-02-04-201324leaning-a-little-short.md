I started leaning a litte short into Friday afternoon&#8217;s melt up.  Over the years I have found that the unemployment number release often marks a change in trend.  Given that I viewed the market as over extended, I thought it presented an interesting risk reward.

Most technicians would recoil in horror for my shorting the breakout:

However, I think that Friday might mark the interim top for this move.

Sentiment is getting very frothy.  More and more I am noticing articles about what a &#8216;great idea&#8217; it is to be buying stocks.  Here are some snippets from this week-end&#8217;s Globe & Mail:

> The end of fear: Why that hoard of cash is streaming into stocks

> The six-figure inheritance Peter Duchenes received three years ago is about to hit the stock market.

> When he first got the money, the 51-year-old actor and director decided to park it in a bank savings account. The interest on it was paltry, but he had no appetite for stocks – put off by the losses he sustained in an account he had with an investment adviser and worried about the upheaval in financial markets.

> But this week, the Ottawa resident opened a new discount brokerage account. Once the paperwork is done, he will join the many investors who are finally getting over the trauma of the great crash of 2008-09 and diving back into equities. After three years of educating himself about the markets, he’s planning to invest the money in exchange-traded funds, which are index-tracking investments that trade like a stock.

When the 51 year old actor that has been avoiding stocks for the last 3 years by parking money in a bank savings account (earning negative real rates) finally decides it is time to dip his toe in the water, **you better be on the other side of his trade!**

Even Barrons, the &#8216;financial pros&#8217; magazine, is falling all over themselves bullish:

This is all happening at a time which seasonally is usually pretty poor for the stock market.  Have a look at this great study by Bespoke Investments:

You will notice that February is a relatively poor month in terms of previous performance.

And finally, I believe that a big factor in this rally has been the extreme Yen weakness.  Japan is the world&#8217;s third biggest economy, and when they are adding liquidity, it is definitely felt in the equity markets.

However, the Yen weakness is way ahead of itself.  I still contend that the move to 100 USDJPY will require more aggressive BoJ actions.  Since Prime Minister Abe is still not in control of the BoJ, which will take until April when he replaces the current Chairman, I think the market will suffer some disappointments in the coming months.  As over bought as I believe the stock market is, I think the Yen is even more over sold.  There are market speculators that who never trade currencies who have piled into the Yen short as the money has been so &#8216;easy&#8217;.  Well if there is one thing I am sure of &#8211; it is that easy money is never easy.

I think we are going to get a correction in the Yen, which will coincide with a correction in the stock market.

Have a look at this chart of the AUDJPY vs the S&P500:

You will notice that the AUDJPY often correlates very strongly with the S&P 500.  If we get a correction in the Yen, I believe it will also affect the stock market.

When you add it all up, you get a stock market that for the brave you should be short, and for everyone else, you should be on the sidelines.
