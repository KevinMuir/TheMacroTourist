Over the last week I had gotten cute and had lifted the short JPY leg of my short Japanese sandwich (short JPY, short JGBs, short Nikkei). &nbsp;I had also even pushed my luck and bought some Yen calls as I was looking for a short squeeze.

Then this week-end the US Treasury issued their report which seemed likely to ignite a wave of covering from the shorts.

Although the Yen did gap higher, so far during the Sunday night session, it is remarkably well behaved. &nbsp;Gold & Silver are getting&nbsp;annihilated&nbsp;and both trading like rats on acid, but the Yen is trading in a sideways docile manner.&nbsp;

While I was Instant Messaging my co-worker Ryan, I said something to the effect that the Yen _should be trading like gold in reverse._ &nbsp;

The simple fact that it is not leads me to the conclusion that we are not going to get the short covering panic I was looking for.

Great bear and bull markets never seem to let you back in.

So, I am going to accept that this Yen bear market is indeed a monster, and stop fighting it. &nbsp;Tonight I have rang the register on my calls. &nbsp;I am now putting back on the short JPY portion of the short Japanese sandwich, and I am going to try to stay out of trouble. &nbsp;No more trying to pick 100 pip counter trend moves in a bear market that might go on for thousands of pips.</p></p>
