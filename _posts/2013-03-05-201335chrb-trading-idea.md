For those that are looking for trade ideas on the long side, here is one that you might want to have a look at.  Chorus Aviation is a stock that was on quite a good run during the last few months of 2012 and the first month of 2013.  During this period it went from $3 to over $4.50.  I believe that this run up was due to a combination of stock specific good news along with a scorching hot airline sector.

Have a look at the FAA ETF which is the Guggenheim Airline ETF.

I don&#8217;t want to go through the fundamentals for CHR.B as this is a pure trading flow call, but it is definitely a name that had a lot of smart investors as holders.  One of those investors took the opportunity afforded from the rally to unload his position to a syndicate of dealers in a bought deal.  The cagey veteran Prem Watsa sold Fairfax&#8217;s stake at $4.50 to the over eager dealers.  In a move that my old boss would describe as &#8216;stuffing them like a butter tart&#8217;, Watsa sold a massive block at a price that was not appropriate for the liquidity of the stock.

Investors shunned the issue and the stock has drifted lower ever since.

This morning the dealers finally relented and have puked out their position at $3.85.  I think it is time to take a little off their hands and play for a bounce.  This is a short term trading call only and I will be gone by the end of the week.

The combination of an airline sector that is hitting new highs along with the fact that CHR.B has been held down from the dealers&#8217; supply, should make this a decent candidate for a good pop on the cleanup.
