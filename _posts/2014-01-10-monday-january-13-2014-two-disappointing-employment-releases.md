On Friday both the US and Canada released their unemployment numbers for the month of December. They were both disappointing, with Canada especially so.

Let&#8217;s first tackle the US numbers. The numbers caught many analysts off side as they had done their best &#8220;extrapolating the past trend forecasting&#8221; and assumed that the improving labour figures would continue for another month. When the numbers were released and it became obvious that this type of trend following only works for front running Bernanke&#8217;s goosing of the equity market, the economists did what all good economists do when they miss a number &#8211; they dismissed the specific release as an aberration.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I realize that this number is prone to volatility, but had the release being an especially good number would they have all dismissed that as an aberration? Does this number only have validity when it comes in close to their estimates? Of course not and that is why their reaction was ridiculous. The release should be viewed with some skepticism regarding the magnitude of its disappointment, but the direction of the miss (lower) should be completely accepted.

The US economy is not creating the jobs that would be expected at this point of the recovery. Full stop. No other way to mince this report and trying to reason it away by blaming it on the weather is simply refusing to change one&#8217;s position when the facts change.

Many economists were even quick to say that this number is not enough to derail the Fed&#8217;s implicit future $10 billion per meeting reduction of QE. What sort of disappointment would have been required then to put the tapering on hold? It seems to me that concluding this doesn&#8217;t alter the Fed&#8217;s plans is very premature. Although the Fed very well might stick to plan, at the very least this release forces the market to dramatically alter the odds that the Fed puts the tapering on hold.

I realize that becoming a chicken little due to one employment number is also a mistake, but it seems to me that the knee jerk ostrich&#8217;s head in the sand response is just as irrational.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I am not claiming to know whether this employment number is the start of something more ominous or simply some noise, but I am smart enough to realize that the odds of the economy starting to roll over have increased and opposed to staying the same.

Although the US number was a disappointment, the Canadian number was a complete train wreck.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The economists were expecting 12k jobs to be created in December, but instead the Canadian economy lost 46k. The US is approximately 10 times the size of Canada, so whereas this month the US added only 87k instead of 200k, the US equivalent for the Canadian number would be for a loss of 460k jobs!<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="USLTJOBsJan1314.gif" alt="USLTJOBsJan1314" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/USLTJOBsJan1314.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">US Monthly payrolls over the last few decades &#8211; only once below 460k!</figcaption></figure> 

Over the last three decades the US has only lost more than 460k jobs once &#8211; and that was during the worst credit crisis since the Great Depression.

The Canadian economy is in terrible shape and this number is simply finally reflecting that reality. On the week-end I was at a family event and was speaking to an Uncle who has a decent sized dental practice in Toronto. In Canada, although our health care is socialized, dental is paid privately, mostly through insurance programs from work. Therefore the dentists get a good feel of how many people are paying out of pocket, or simply not coming in because of no insurance. He was telling me that it is absolutely brutal out there and that the patients in his practice are really suffering.

The Canadian dollar reacted as would be expected and has moved to new lows against the US dollar:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Although the Loonie has had quite a move downward, so far it has been quite slow and plodding. Some strategists are warning that it is oversold and crowded with many late shorts that are pushing their luck:<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="CADSpecJan1314.gif" alt="CADSpecJan1314" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/CADSpecJan1314.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Canadian Dollar Speculators&#8217; Net position &#8211; they are short and it is somewhat worrisome</figcaption></figure> 

I am sympathetic to the view that it is by no means an undiscovered trade, but given the relative calmness of the move, I am not yet worried that it is crowded to the point where we will see a counter trend move just due to the sheer number of participants on one side of the boat.

**I did add to the position on Friday, but I shorted more CAD against the Japanese Yen.** I did a very small amount as compared to my short position against the USD, but I felt that the Yen was also a crowded trade that is due for a strong counter trend move.

As I finish writing this post up this morning, I realize that I should really be shorting more CAD against the Euro as for all the reasons I discussed previously &#8211; the ECB is too tight.

The Bank of Canada currently has overnight rates set at 1%. Most of the rest of the major Central Banks are down at the 0-0.25% range, so the Bank of Canada is actually in the unique position of being able to lower rates. Given the current sad state of our economy, I fully expect them to do so.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Sometimes trading is simple and the hard part is sitting tight with a position that is working for you.  This is the current situation with the Canadian dollar.  No need to over think it.  Our economy is bad, rates are headed lower and the CAD will be the asset that adjusts the most.

**Things that I am watching**

**Corn finally stops going down!**

I am long (and wrong) Corn so it is with a certain degree of relief that I greeted Friday&#8217;s emotional move in the agriculture pit. Corn had pushed to a new brutal low for this move, but then on the release of the USDA supply report, rocketed higher to close at a new weekly high.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

We have a long way to go before we can say this is anything more than a short covering rally, but there is no doubt that the whole commodity sector is deeply oversold and due for a decent rally.

**Positions**

**Short Canadian dollar.** CAD continues to quietly sink.  Conviction level: 4. Stops to come.  **UPDATE:  Short CAD against JPY**.  Small position size.  **Will add short CADEUR sometime today.**

**Long various natural gas contracts UPDATE.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather. Conviction level: 3 No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** Not the greatest trade so far, but I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. I have no long hedge on versus this position, but I am thinking about reinstating one into the recent weakness in the S&P 500. Conviction level: 3. No stop for now.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** I am long bond market volatility as I think the next crisis will start in the bond market. Conviction level: 3.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 6
