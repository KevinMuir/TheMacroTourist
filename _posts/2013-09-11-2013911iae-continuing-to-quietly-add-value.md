My favourite energy stock, Ithaca Energy IAE announced some great news overnight on their Stella Well.

I will leave it to much smarter people to dissect the news and give you the intricacies about what the results mean.  I will discuss the only aspect that I understand &#8211; market psychology.

This is a quiet stock with very little speculation built in.  Over the past few years, in true Sottish fashion, management has inconspicuously gone about creating real value for shareholders.

It might look like today&#8217;s gap higher should be sold:

However, in the long run, this stock is still dirt cheap and well off the highs seen during the previous takeover frenzy:

Even though I am probably much too long, and I know the fate of pigs as opposed to bulls and bears, I am going to hang tough and not sell any into this rally.

There is virtually no speculative premium built into the IAE stock price.  There is no need for good news to justify the current price and surprises will most likely continue to be the upside due to the lack of hype in the name.

I still think that the end game for Ithaca is a much bigger energy company buying them at a significant premium.  Until that time, I am going to stick with my Scottish brethren and let them continue to quietly add value.
