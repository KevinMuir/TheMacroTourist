There is one consequence of the Washington debacle that we can be fairly certain of &#8211; it has increased the likelihood that the tapering of the QE program will be put off further into the future. 

This morning Federal Reserve Governor Richard Fisher confirmed this fact with these comments:

> FISHER: FISCAL SHENANIGANS HAVE \`SWAMPED&#8217; QE TAPER PROSPECTS
> 
> FISHER: HARD TO NOW ARGUE TO CHANGE COURSE OF MONETARY POLICY
> 
> U.S. FED&#8217;S FISHER REPEATS BEST TO &#8216;STAY THE COURSE&#8217; ON BOND BUYING AT OCTOBER FOMC MEETING 

It is made all the more worrisome in that Fisher is generally considered the &#8220;hawk&#8221; on the FOMC.

A lot of market participants mistakenly believe this to be a bond friendly development. I don&#8217;t hold the same view. 

Have a look at the US 30 year yield with the QE programs outlined in blue:

You will notice that during the QE periods, yields _actually increased._ Both times when QE1 and QE2 ended, yields dramatically fell.

Obviously it is not quite as simple as that, but at the margin, I view the fact that QE tapering has been put off as ultimately bond bearish. I am short bonds, and see no reason to change. 

I think the real damage is going to be done to the US dollar. The shenanigans in Washington have had the double effect of increasing the amount of monetary stimulus and also casting doubts about the long run attractiveness of US assets. These are both negative developments for the US dollar and it is responding by sinking to back to the lows:

I am considering whether to climb aboard the trade by shorting US dollars. For now I am going to watch as my long gold behaves in a similar fashion to a short US dollar position, but I would understand those that would want to push their luck and also get short the US dollar in here.
