I can&#8217;t remember who coined the line &#8216;you can&#8217;t call yourself a true macro trader until you have lost a fortune shorting JGBs&#8217; but I cannot help but be reminded of the wisdom of that statement as I stare at the P&L for JGB futures in my inventory.  It is made all the worse by the fact that the Yen trades at 94 Yen to the US dollar, so when you look at the P&L it seems to always have an ungodly number of  digits in it.  That is fine when there is a plus sign at the beginning of the number, but when it is a negative it always seems to give you a kick in the stomach.

On the whole, I have had a decent little run of late, but I sure have called this short JGB trade poorly.  It is made all the worse by the fact that although I was very short JPY for the beginning of the latest Japanese easing move, I got cute and tried to time it.  In doing so, I of course missed the last 25% of the move.  The Market Gods do not appreciate getting cute with positions and I am sure they are waiting for me to put the short Yen back on before allowing the inevitable Yen correction to occur.

Although the Market Gods also frown upon adding to a losing position (especially one like short JGBs that have been doing nothing but go up for the last two decades), I am going to respectfully add to my position.  Sometimes knowing when to break the rules is the most important skill to have.  I am hoping that this is one of those times.

Since the election of the new Prime Minister Abe a few months back, the Japanese financial markets have experienced some very dramatic moves.  The pledge to stop two decades of deflation seems to have worked wonders to both the currency and stock market:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/JPY%20Mar%2026%2013.jpg" /><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/NKY%20Mar%2026%2013.jpg" />

However, very little has actually changed in terms of monetary policy.  The markets reacted this strongly simply on the belief that this Japanese administration was serious about ending the relentless deflation.

To some extent the moves were also exaggerated due to the massively pessimistic investor attitudes towards Japan.  Although it seems like ages ago, I distinctly remember the skepticism as Abe was campaigning.  Most financial pundits simply dismissed him as another inept Prime Minister candidate who was likely to prove ineffective at escaping the deflationary spiral.  As it became clear that Abe was going to win, and not only that, might in fact institute his aggressive monetary and fiscal policy, investors scrambled to buy Japanese stocks that they were dramatically underweight and short Yen which had strangely become a safe haven currency during the Eurocrisis.  **_To a large degree these moves were simply the markets front running Abe&#8217;s bold economic reforms._**   This is also why I abandoned my Yen short last month &#8211; I felt that we were about to enter into an environment where actual aggressive policy would have to be implemented before the Yen decline would continue.  However, I underestimated how far it could run without policy being actually changed.

What is most interesting is that when you examine Abe&#8217;s policies to date, they seem to have worked wonders.  **_Abeconomics,_** as it is being called, is being heralded as ushering in the resurgence of the Japanese economy.  So far, the policy has had nothing but upside with no side effects.  The stock market is up 44%, while the JGB market has rallied smarty thus dramatically reducing the cost of borrowing for the Japanese government.  Here is a chart of the 10 Year JGB yield:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/JGB%2010%20YR%20Mar%2026%2013.gif" />

How can this be?  Is directing Japan out of its two decade deflationary collapse as simple as just jawboning it out of existence?  And if this &#8216;Abeconomics&#8217; is really this effective, won&#8217;t all countries be quickly adopting it?  Is this not a cure that would solve the Western countries&#8217; problems of slowing economies and high debt burdens?  What could be better than a rocketing stock market and lowered borrowing costs?  Surely all governments want that.

I am sure you can sense my skepticism.  I do not believe for one second that &#8216;Abeconomics&#8217; is as effective or as costless as the market is currently discounting.

Japan&#8217;s economy is a long term disaster that is plague by declining demographics, massive misallocation of resources and declining competitiveness.  Simply declaring that you are going to target 2% inflation (the crux of Abeconomics) is not going to magically create anywhere near the wealth that investors are now predicting.

I am not going to bother going through all the long run challenges that Japan faces.  If you are interested just google any of Kyle Bass&#8217; recent speeches.  As Kyle likes to say (and I am paraphrasing), you might disagree with policies or opinions, but math is math &#8211; and Japan&#8217;s math looks terrible.

What I find most interesting is the reaction that Japanese financial assets are having as the government tries to stick handle their way out of this predicament.

The Yen&#8217;s decline is very understandable.  I have long argued that the long run value of the Yen has to be significantly lower.  And although I understand the forces that took the Yen to its massively overvalued level (deflation is contractionary and reduces the supply of Yen thus sending it higher), this currency strength created a boom bust cycle which the longer it continued meant that the inevitable adjustment would be all the larger.   Therefore once the cycle had turned, it is not surprising that the Yen has moved as far and as quickly as it did.  In fact the surprise will most likely be how far it travels in the coming years and decades.  This is not a move that is going to stop at 100 USDJPY.  This will most likely be a move that ultimately sees the Yen go to 150 or 200 USDJPY.  So in the grand scheme of things, this start of the Yen&#8217;s decline is probably appropriate.

The stock market&#8217;s reaction is also easy to explain.  Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies are stock market friendly.  When you combine that with the fact that two decades of Japanese stock market underperformance had left almost every portfolio throughout the world underweight Japanese equities, there was all the ingredients for a massive short squeeze.

The JGB market is a little more surprising.  Now many will say, &#8216;no it&#8217;s not &#8211; the BoJ is going to be buying JGBs so it makes sense that they are rallying.&#8217;  However, as I have gone through in many other posts, Quantitative Easing is in fact bond market negative.  Although the Central Bank is buying bonds, ultimately that is inflationary and causes bond markets to back up.  If the QE is successful, then bonds should actually go down during the Central Bank buying.

However, this is not happened and I am left to figure out why not.

What I am faced to conclude is that the reason the JGB market has not yet sold off is that the aggressive Quantitative Easing has not yet happened.  The added policies are still to be implemented.  Between choosing a new BoJ governor and the whole process of getting the rules changed to allow this massive amount of easing, the blue tickets have not yet been executed.

These moves in Japanese financial assets were simply the front running of anticipated increased QE.  Which leaves me with the question, how do I want to trade going forward?

If I am correct that QE is ultimately bond market unfriendly, then assuming the Japanese government is successful in their reflation attempts, then shorting JGBs is the winning trade.

When I combine that analysis with my anecdotal observations of how market participants are positioned to take advantage of the new Japanese programs, I am further encouraged that this is the right way to go.  Most hedge funds are long Nikkei stock index futures and maybe short Yen.   It seems that no one is shorting JGBs.

However I think the best risk reward is shorting the JGB futures.  JGBs are currently yielding 54 basis points with the Japanese government promising to achieve a 2% inflation rate, all the while the Japanese debt burden continues to reach mind boggling large levels.  There seems to be so many plates in the air that I am very suspicious that it is all going to work out so nicely.  Either the JGB market is going to back up because the Japanese government achieves the growth they are targeting, or it is going to back up because investors wake up to the fact that Japan&#8217;s long run finances are inescapably on a trajectory for disaster.  The absurdity of the most indebted nation on earth embarking on a massive expansionary initiative all the while their 10 year bond market is trading at measly 54 basis points is shocking.  It is all the more confusing that this is not a case of the markets not believing the stimulus is going to work as the Yen and the Nikkei are suggesting the very opposite.  One of these assets is dramatically mis-priced and it is my guess that the JGBs are ripe for a fall.

However to offer a little bit of a hedge, I am also going to short Nikkei in US dollar terms.

As it stands now, the aggressive currency devaluation / economic reflation seems to be a free lunch.  The Nikkei seems to be saying that you can simply create wealth by devaluing your currency.  I don&#8217;t believe in free lunches and am suspicious whenever hedge funds all seem to be leaning one way.  Given the popularity of being long Japanese stocks and my worry about the markets in general, I am going to short Nikkei priced in US dollars.  To accomplish this I am going to short Nikkei futures traded in US dollars and also short the equivalent position in Yen currency futures.  It is a bet that the supposed real wealth created with the monster rise in the Nikkei will prove to be less in real terms than market participants believe.

So far Abeconomics has been nothing but clear sailing.  However, I am willing to bet that it is not quite that simple&#8230;
