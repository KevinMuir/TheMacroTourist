  One of my biggest pet peeves is the tendency of the media to vault strategists and portfolio managers whose long term views happen to work in the short run to the height of popularity. It doesn’t matter if the pundit has been calling for an asset price to rise during the last 10 years of the greatest bear market in history, if there is a bounce, then all of a sudden their views are presented as expert commentary. The investing public all too often doesn’t realize the old adage, ‘the markets make the news, not the other way round.’

  There are many perma bulls (or bears) that I read all the time. Often they are some of the smartest investors out there. However, when David Rosenberg is bearish on the economy or Eric Sprott is bullish on precious metals it is about as insightful as saying that Lindsay Lohan likes the odd cocktail. What is important is to watch them for slight changes to their long held views.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  When at the margin Rosie becomes a little less bearish or Eric a little less enthusiastic, that is the time to perk your ears up. Otherwise their views are not going to change, and their popularity in the press will simply be reflection of the current state of the market. Their predictive power lies in the shift of their opinion, not of their opinion.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  The difficult part of navigating the investment landscape is that many of these long term macro views are very appealing. <strong><em>However, deciding when a ‘problem’ becomes a ‘real problem’ is the real art to trading.</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I do not profess any ability to say with any surety when a ‘problem’ will become an investable theme, but I am always on the lookout for these types of changes. This type of trading makes me more prone to zipping in and out of positions instead of sticking with a long term theme through the various ebbs and flows of the market. If you want a perma-position trader go look somewhere else &#8211; I am not your man.

  Which brings me to the real reason for this morning’s post. I am not saying this with 100% certainty, but yesterday’s decision by the Germans to repatriate their gold might mark the beginning of the next stage of the gold bull market.
</p>

  There is a famous Canadian fund manager who believes that the Federal Reserve does not have the gold in the vault. His theories strike me as a little on the tin foil hat side (<img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_foil_hat" target="_blank">wikipedia entry</a>) as I have no worries that the Federal Reserve has engaged in a massive deception to hide the fact that it has secretly sold all of its gold.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  However, I believe that Germany’s repatriation signals an increasing distrust amongst Central Banks. I have a theory that when it comes to traffic it is easy for everyone to be polite to one and another when traffic is light. But when things get busier, suddenly the politeness disappears as individuals are faced with the fact that their drive is going to take longer and their self interest rises to the fore. This is the perfect analogy for the increasingly difficult global economic situation. In times of increasing prosperity it is easy for governments to engage in free trade and other mutually beneficial economic policies. During times of economic stress (as we are increasingly facing), it is not quite as <em>easy</em> for governments to do the <em>right thing</em>. They start looking for shortcuts. They stop letting in other drivers and instead focus on their own situation. It becomes more and more every man (government) for himself.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Last year’s Swiss pegging of their currency was the first shot across the bow of this new reality. Japan’s recent hard turn towards aggressive devaluation is another example. Increasingly countries are doing what is their own ‘self interest’ and abandoning free markets.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  In the coming years, as the reality of the aftermath of the bursting of the super credit bubble becomes more clear, we will continue to see countries become increasingly desperate, resulting in more devaluations and other economic policies that are deemed to be in their own ‘self interest.’
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Germany’s decision to repatriate their gold is a move protect themselves against this eventuality. I do not blame Germany one iota for demanding their gold be held in their country. Do not forget that it was 80 years ago that Roosevelt confiscated all gold from US citizens. Desperate governments do desperate things.

<p class="p1">
  As the chairs continue to be removed in this game of musical chairs, governments will take extreme actions. James Rickards, in his book Currency Wars, has suggested that the US might not return Germany’s gold. I think this is a little far fetched, but there is no doubt that the stakes are increasing.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <strong><em>Yesterday’s announcement by Germany very well might be one of those events that marks when a ‘problem’ becomes a ‘real problem’.</em></strong> This might be the catalyst for the next move higher in the gold market.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Over the last decade, the global financial environment has become a Mexican standoff where there is an uneasy equilibrium. Although it is played out in months, quarters and even years, we are approaching the end game where it is every man for himself. The German decision reflects this reality.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Will the markets figure this out? Will this be the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back? I think you need to very seriously consider the possibility that this decision will mark the catalyst in the next bull move higher. Trade accordingly.
