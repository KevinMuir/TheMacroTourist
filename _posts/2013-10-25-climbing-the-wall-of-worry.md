We all know the old adage that bull markets love to climb a wall of worry. The difficult arises in the fact that no matter where we are in the cycle, there are always some really smart sounding arguments that make the bear case seem really appealing. The trick is being able to decide when these argument &#8220;matter&#8221; and when they are problems for another day. 

Over the years I have found that one of the easiest ways to gauge whether these worries are simply part of the wall that we need to climb, or more ominously a real signal that you should be reducing risk is the attitude of the public towards these concerns. When these worries are truly on the mind of investors, in your day to day life, any mention of these concerns will bring at least some sympathetic responses. The point where you should be concerned is when you mention these worries and the general response is to dismiss and even ridicule your worries. This spring when I expressed concern about the bond market being over bought and priced for perfection, almost everyone told me that there was no inflation and that the bond market was the only place to be. Well, over the next couple of quarters, the bond market proceeded to get absolutely hammered &#8211; even though everyone was absolutely sure of what a great investment it was only a few months previously.

Today we are in a similar situation, but it isn&#8217;t the bond market this time. Everyone is absolutely sure that stocks (and especially those of the US tech variety) are a great investment. When I express caution about getting overly confident, I am once again met with the same sort of dismissal and ridicule that was expressed about the bond market less than a year ago.

There is no longer a wall of worry to climb &#8211; we are over the top and are climbing into the stratosphere on a rope tenuously tied to some sort of unknown attachment in the sky. It is no longer a situation where worries are priced into the market and therefore we can handle bad news. No, it is a point where good news is increasingly fully priced in and things have to go perfectly to justify the current prices.

And lately the macro news has not being that good, yet the market is choosing to ignore the facts and continue to streak higher. I know the bulls&#8217; reasons &#8211; don&#8217;t think that I am unaware of why we are heading higher. I have lived through a few bubbly bull markets and understand how they can go much longer than anyone estimates. I also understand the massive amount of fuel that the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have poured onto the markets with their massive QE programs. So I am by no means saying that there is no way we are heading higher. We very well could explode even higher and things get even stupider.

However, when the bad news starts to pile up, and the market looks increasingly heavy, but the public&#8217;s attitude continues to be unfazed, I step back and say that the risk reward does not favour any longs and in fact, it is time to try a short position.

Let&#8217;s go over some of the flashing warning signs.

The total margin debt at the NYSE has hit an all time:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/SP500vsMarOct2513.gif" alt="SP500vsMarOct2513" title="SP500vsMarOct2513.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

You can see that the S&P (yellow line) seems to follow the margin debt remarkably accurately. Now this doesn&#8217;t mean that we can&#8217;t go even higher with margin debt, but at the minimum you should be looking at the total debt and maybe giving you a reason for pause.

And the macro environment is increasingly not confirming the stock market&#8217;s enthusiasm. Have a look at the S&P versus Inverted Weekly Jobless claims:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/SPvsInvertedClaimsOct2513.gif" alt="SPvsInvertedClaimsOct2513" title="SPvsInvertedClaimsOct2513.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

The S&P (in orange) has been charging higher ignoring the increased jobless claims (inverted in white). The recent budget fiasco has obviously not helped, but the last terrible employment report was &#8216;clean&#8217; in that it was before the shutdown and it was showing increased strains in the labour market. 

Another fundamental indicator that I watch closely was developed by Ed Yardeni. It uses a combination of economic statistics along with commodity prices to produce an indicator that tracks the stock market quite well:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/YardeniOct2513.gif" alt="YardeniOct2513" title="YardeniOct2513.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

You will notice that this indicator (in white) turned sharply lower, yet the stock market (in orange) is once again powering to new highs.

Not only do we have some fundamental indicators rolling over, but some of the authorities are also expressing some concerns about conditions becoming too loose. 

Yesterday the Federal Reserve reported that it was going to issue a formal warning about lax leveraged loan underwriting standards. The cov-light deals and other aggressive lending are obviously drawing the attention of the Fed. Whether a warning will be enough to slow down the lending is yet to be seen, **but it is not bullish and in fact could very well be a much bigger deal than the market realizes.**

And it is not only the Fed that is getting worried about loose credit. The Chinese have recently once again expressed some concern about their increasing real estate (and other) prices. Over the last few days the SHIBOR rate has been steadily increasing indicating that the Bank of China is withdrawing liquidity from the system. So far the move has been small compared to earlier in the year when rates spiked higher and scared the entire global risk taking appetite:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/ChinaONOct2513.gif" alt="ChinaONOct2513" title="ChinaONOct2513.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

However, I am watching this closely for signs that this is the start of a bigger move to withdraw liquidity. Again, it is not bullish for world markets.

Finally, let&#8217;s not forget out European friends. Although Merkel is busy reaming out Obama for listening to her phone calls, she should be more concerned about what the financial authorities under her watch are doing.

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/cfae6135c61bb0906fadcec82e470e36.jpeg" alt="Cfae6135c61bb0906fadcec82e470e36" title="cfae6135c61bb0906fadcec82e470e36.jpeg" border="0" width="400" height="600" />

The ECB is consistently shrinking the size of their balance sheet:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/ECBTotalOct2513.jpg" alt="ECBTotalOct2513" title="ECBTotalOct2513.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="439" />

Their withdrawal of liquidity will be felt in their economy &#8211; the only question is when. 

And it doesn&#8217;t help that their bank regulators are running around warning about banks failing the latest stress test. From ZH:

> As Draghi himself noted, in a desparate plea to maintain some credibility &#8220;banks do need to fail&#8221; to prove the credibility of the exercise, adding &#8220;if they do have to fail, they have to fail. Thereâ€™s no question about that.&#8221;.

I am short Europe and am only becoming more emboldened about that position.

There are flashing warning signs springing up all around the world. 

The markets are so far immune, but it is dangerous to simply ignore all of these signs, comforting yourself with the idea that markets climb a wall of worry. There is no more worry left in the markets &#8211; only dangerous over optimism and complacency.
