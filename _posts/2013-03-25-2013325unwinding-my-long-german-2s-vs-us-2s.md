In January I put on a long German 2 year bund position vs. a short US 2 T-note position when the two securities were trading at approximately the same yield.  [(previous post)](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2013/1/30/eyz9614qe3427aeaf61qwwgijqkkrm)

Since then I have been fortunate to have actually called this one correctly and the German yield has come way down versus the US Yield.

Here is the chart of the spread between the two securities&#8217; yields:

Although I am extremely bearish on Europe, the German 2 year bund is yielding almost zero and for me to stay long means betting on negative nominal rates.  It very well could happen, but I hate to be long securities yielding zero.

So I am ringing the register and covering the entire position.
