A couple of days ago there were some relatively dovish noises emitted by Bundesband Bank Governor Weidman.

> &#8220;ECB may cut interest rates if new info warrants&#8221;

I know that doesn&#8217;t sound very dovish when you compare it to Bernanke or Kuroda, but in the world of Germanic monetary conservatism, this is akin to chugging a mickey of vodka and dancing on the table with no shirt on.  The EUR reacted appropriately and actually went down in the hopes that the ECB might join the US, Japanese and UK money printing party sooner rather than later.

However, this morning the German government made it perfectly clear that they want absolutely nothing to do with that sort of reckless talk.  German Finance Minister Schaeuble is all over the tape:

  * SCHAEUBLE SAYS ECB SHOULD REDUCE LIQUIDITY IN EURO AREA
  * <span style="letter-spacing: normal">SCHAEUBLE SAYS &#8216;TOO MUCH MONEY&#8217; IN THE MARKET</span>
  * <span style="letter-spacing: normal">SCHAEUBLE SAYS WOULD WELCOME ACTION TO REDUCE LIQUIDITY</span>
  * <span style="letter-spacing: normal">SCHAEUBLE SAYS MANY EU COUNTRIES IN &#8216;PRECARIOUS ECONOMIC SITUATION&#8217;</span>

Now let&#8217;s see&#8230;  Many member countries in a &#8216;precarious economic situation&#8217;, yet the best course of action is to reduce liquidity?

Is the EU experiencing a massive inflation that is crushing their economy?  Let&#8217;s check their CPI:

Nope, as far as I can see, the CPI is low and looking like it is headed lower.

Maybe the EUR is plummeting which is signalling there is way too much liquidity in their system.  Let&#8217;s have a look at that chart:

Nope, nothing ominous looking about that all.

Maybe the ECB balance sheet is expanding like my waistline.  Let&#8217;s have a look at their balance sheet over the last year:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/ECB%20All%20Assets%20Apr%2019%2013.gif" />

Again, nothing there.  In fact the balance sheet is contracting quickly.

But I guess it isn&#8217;t contracting quickly enough for the Germans.

I am short European stocks and I am adding to it.  The Germans are confirming that they are going to drive the European economy right off the cliff.  I am not judging whether in the long run it is the correct course of action (these other money printing economies might in fact have their comeuppance that makes the Germans look wise), but I do know that over the short to medium term, this policy is extremely negative for European stocks.  I am trading accordingly.
