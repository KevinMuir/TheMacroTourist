The US economy keeps marginally improving bit by bit and Friday&#8217;s encouraging employment report has put the tapering right back to the forefront of investors&#8217; worries. During the employment report coverage, I was listening to Bloomberg radio and PIMCO&#8217;s Bill Gross said that the odds of a December tapering is now 50%/50%. I see no reason to quibble with Bill&#8217;s assessment of the probabilities. 

I do believe that any taper of the QE programs will be accompanied by either a cut in the Interest on Reserves or a firming of commitment to forward guidance. The Fed is keen to make sure that any reduction in bond buying does not unnerve the short end of the bond market.

Last time the market priced in the taper, they were quick to assume that the taper marked the beginning of tightening process. The entire bond market got hit, but most disturbingly for the Fed, even the short end backed up hard. The two year Treasury yield rallied from 30 basis point to almost 55 basis points. The market basically brought forward the Fed tightening to a point that actually affected the economy by starting to tighten financial conditions:

The Fed _does not want a repeat_ of this episode, so they will not taper without some sort of assurances or signal that this does not mean that rates are going to be raised anytime soon. They simply want to ease up on their purchases without changing the forward path of rates.

My bet is that they actually lower the interest on reserves as I think that the subsidy given to the banks through the Fed&#8217;s policies has begun to be understood by the media. For a while after the credit crisis the banks were in need of this subsidy, but at this point with banks hitting new 5 year highs, while the average worker is still struggling, the Fed would be wise to do everything they can to affect the _actual economy as opposed to the financial markets._ Lowering the interest on reserves would be a step in the right direction.

Regardless of how the Fed couches it, the market is going to be faced with a taper sooner rather than later.

I have argued that the Fed is going to be overly easy for too long, so that the last thing you should be worried about is the Fed getting out ahead of the curve. They are gun shy about choking off the fragile recovery, so the mistake is going to be tapering too little too late, not the other way round.

However, right now, there a lot of equity investors sitting with very large profits going into year end. Everybody is expecting a Santa Claus rally (even those that don&#8217;t believe in Santa Claus!), and sentiment is about as lopsided as you can get.

Even though I think you should not fear the taper, there is going to be at the very least a reluctance to commit new money with this worry overhanging the stock market. Therefore I expect we are going to struggle and grind lower for the next couple of weeks until the December 17th & 18th FOMC meeting.

I then expect that you are going to get the actual taper announcement coupled with an IOER (interest on excess reserves) cut. 

As far as equity market trading goes, there is a decent chance that this will set up as a sell the rumour, buy the news event.

Therefore, I am going to lean ever so slightly short for the next couple of weeks, with the idea of covering going into the meeting next week. I am going to sell strength as although I don&#8217;t fear the taper, I am not so sure that everyone else feels the same way.
