I have watched in amazement over the last few months as Canadian stock markets have been completely decimated.  The carnage has been especially pronounced in the small cap space and nothing illustrates this more than the S&P TSX Venture exchange chart:

This morning, for the first time in a long, long while, Canadian stocks seem to be better bid than most other stock markets.

I am going to do a little bottom fishing and buy some TSX while selling S&P 500.  Here is a chart of the two indexes over the last little while:

This is definitely a trade that no risk manager would like, but I really feel that Canadian stocks are due for a bounce on a relative basis.  We have been beat up enough.
