Everyone is familiar with the famous line about being at a poker table and looking around to see who the chump is&#8230;  Well, it seems to me that the ECB is still trying to figure it out which does not bode well for Europe.

Today ECB Central Bank council member Weidmann said the following in regards to the value of the Euro:

> Feb. 11 (Bloomberg) &#8212; European Central Bank council member Jens Weidmann said the euro isn’t seriously overvalued and warned governments against trying to weaken the currency.

> “Experience from previous, politically induced depreciations show that they don’t normally lead to a sustained increase in competitiveness,” Weidmann said. “Often, more and more depreciations are necessary. If more and more countries try to depress their currency, it will end in a depreciation competition, which will only produce losers.”

Yes Weidmann might be correct in his analysis of the long term effects of depreciations.  But what our favourite German central banker is missing is the fact there are considerable advantages to the countries who depreciate first.

Here is a great chart produced by Morgan Stanley that outlines the depreciation of various countries during the last great currency war of the 1930s versus the relative economic performance:

You will notice that France and Germany, who were the last to devalue against gold, suffered disproportionally.  The countries that devalued first were able to &#8216;steal&#8217; some of the last remaining economic growth.

In my mind Germany (and by extension Europe) is once again making the very same mistake.

Yes, the whole world would be better off if there was no currency devaluations.  Like most wars, there are no real winners in a currency war either.  It is only a question of who loses least.

However it is naive to think that the world is going to listen to Germany&#8217;s well reasoned arguments.  The reality is that everyone is going to pay lip service to the economic truths, and then simply do the exact opposite while quietly thanking themselves that there is indeed a chump at the poker table.

Weidmann continues to make the unrealistic demand that politicians make the hard decisions:

>     “The problems can only be solved by politics, central banks can’t do it,” he said. “Therefore, the discussion about an allegedly overvalued euro is only diverting attention from the actual challenges.”

When have you ever seen a politician make a difficult decision that will make a large percentage of his electorate upset?  Never.  Weidmann is extremely foolish to think it is going to happen.

Given that the ECB continues down the road of refusing to join the print-fest that Japan, Switzerland and the US are engaged in, the European economy will experience sub-par growth coupled with asset deflation.

Therefore, it is time to add to our short European stocks trade.

The EuroStoxx 50 has bounced very little considering that the US S&P 500 hit new highs on Friday:

The CAC-40, which I am especially bearish on, looks even worse:

The rest of world stock markets are rushing to new highs, yet Europe is rolling over.

The technicals are lining up with the fundamentals and it is time to push the trade.

I am concentrating on the CAC-40 as I think ultimately the ECB&#8217;s tight policies are going to effect France the worst.  I am doubling up on my short CAC position on Weidmann&#8217;s comments.
