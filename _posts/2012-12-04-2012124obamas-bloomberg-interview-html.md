    Obama has just finished his first interview since being re-elected President. What was especially interesting was that he granted Bloomberg the scoop. Usually this sort of prestige would have been bestowed on NBC, ABC or maybe CNN. Giving the interview to Bloomberg was specifically orchestrated as the President wanted to send a clear message to the business community.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What was the message that Obama felt was so important? It is my opinion that Obama has quite clearly signalled that he is not going to budge on the idea that taxes have to go up for the wealthier Americans. Obama stated that the GOP proposal &#8220;right now is still out of balance&#8221;. The President chose Bloomberg to give this message because he wants the business community to apply pressure to the Republican party. He is trying to say, &#8220;I am being reasonable, but your party is not doing the same &#8211; make them smarten up.&#8221;
  </p>

    Unfortunately, I do not believe that this will work. The Republicans are not going to roll over simply because Obama went on Bloomberg TV.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The fact that Obama is making public comments that are somewhat incendiary in tone shows that the two sides are still <em><strong>very far apart.</strong></em>

    I was hopeful that the US politicians would see that their approval ratings were at all time lows and decide to put aside their partisan bickering for the good of the country.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>However, today&#8217;s Bloomberg interview has shown that this is not the case.</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Whereas a couple of weeks ago I felt that the market was positioned to assume the worst and that the risks were that politicians surprise us by coming to a deal, I now feel that the market is increasingly optimistic that the politicians are not stupid enough to drive over the cliff and market participants have priced in too little of that possibility.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am abandoning my general bullish bias and heading to the sidelines.
