A few weeks ago I decided to short the Carl Icahn AAPL squeeze.  Although I was a couple of days early, my timing wasn&#8217;t half bad and within a week, I was onside as AAPL dipped to $485.

Unfortunately, I overstayed my welcome and the stock has rallied back to my shorting point.

I am going to clean up this position and take the push.  The original premise was that the Icahn news was over done, but we have now long passed the point where that is affecting the stock.
