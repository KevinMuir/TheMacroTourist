On Monday the market had a big down day, the first in a long while. On Tuesday, this was all forgotten and we retraced almost all of the weakness in a big up day.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="SPYGIPJan1414.gif" alt="SPYGIPJan1414" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/SPYGIPJan1414.gif" width="600" height="429" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Last three days of trading in the S&P &#8211; almost like Monday didn&#8217;t happen</figcaption></figure> 

My plan had been to use strength to establish a new short in the S&P and yesterday I put on half of that position. Today is a rather large POMO day (the Fed is buying $4-5 billion of treasuries instead of the usual $1-2 billion), so I am looking for this strength to continue and will use the rally to put out the other half.

Although many bulls are gleefully chiding the bears for being so stupid to think that the weakness would last longer than 24 hours, I am not nearly as optimistic that Monday&#8217;s big sell off should be dismissed.

I think the market is still very over bought and prone to a large correction. I never expected it to go straight down and I am happy to use this strength to sell into.

I very well might be wrong, but I think the jury is still out whether the coast is truly clear.

And if anything, yesterday&#8217;s developments have made me even more bearish.

Fed Governor Fisher made one of the most amazing speeches that I have ever seen a Fed Governor make. Now we all know that Fisher is a hawk. We know that he thinks the time to taper is now. However, there is a certain protocol that the Federal Reserve members use when making speeches. Yes, you can disagree, but this speech went way beyond a slight difference in opinion about the timing of the taper.

Fisher is _extremely concerned_ about the froth in the financial markets. He is worried about the Fed&#8217;s exit strategy and thinks that the Fed has over stayed their welcome at the party.

Let&#8217;s just start with the title of the speech &#8211; &#8220;Beer Goggles, Monetary Camels, the Eye of the Needle and the First Law of Holes.&#8221; Pretty great title and you have to give the guy credit for spicing up what is all too often a dry speech.  From the speech:

> The first was by Peter Boockvar, who is among the plethora of analysts offering different viewpoints that I regularly read to get a sense of how we are being viewed in the marketplace. Here is a rather pungent quote from a note he sent out on Jan. 2:
> 
> “…QE [quantitative easing] puts beer goggles on investors by creating a line of sight where everything looks good…”

> Boockvar is right. When money available to investors is close to free and is widely available, and there is a presumption that the central bank will keep it that way indefinitely, discount rates applied to assessing the value of future cash flows shift downward, making for lower hurdle rates for valuations. A bull market for stocks and other claims on tradable companies ensues; the financial world looks rather comely.
> 
> Market operators donning beer goggles and even some sober economists consider analysts like Boockvar party poopers. But I have found myself making arguments similar to his and to those of other skeptics at recent FOMC meetings, pointing to some developments that signal we have made for an intoxicating brew as we have continued pouring liquidity down the economy’s throat.

This has an eerie similarity to Greenspan&#8217;s famous irrational exuberance speech:

> Clearly, sustained low inflation implies less uncertainty about the future, and lower risk premiums imply higher prices of stocks and other earning assets. We can see that in the inverse relationship exhibited by price/earnings ratios and the rate of inflation in the past. But how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade? And how do we factor that assessment into monetary policy? We as central bankers need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs, and price stability.

Greenspan merely _questioned_ as to how you identify a bubble. He didn&#8217;t say there was a bubble, all he did was wonder out loud about its possibility.

Fisher has done a lot more than wonder out loud. He has clearly stated that he thinks QE is causing exuberance in the financial markets.

And in fact, he does more than that.

> Here is the point as to the market’s beer goggles. Were a stock market correction to ensue while I have the vote, I would not flinch from supporting continued reductions in the size of our asset purchases as long as the real economy is growing, cyclical unemployment is declining and demand-driven deflation remains a small tail risk; I would vote for continued reductions in our asset purchases, with an eye toward eliminating them entirely at the earliest practicable date.

Fisher is trying to withdraw (or at least lower the strike) the so called Bernanke put &#8211; although I guess it is now the Yellen put.

I also believe that Fisher is at the forefront of what I believe will be a withdrawal on the reliance of QE and a move towards other monetary easing policies.

> But my confidence will be bolstered if my colleagues adopt the First Law of Holes espoused in the late ’70s by then-British Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey: “If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.”
> 
> The housing market is well along in repair;[5] the economy is expanding; cyclical unemployment is declining. To be sure, there will be individual data points that appear to challenge confidence, like the just-released employment report for December. But I believe the odds favor continued economic progress. And I believe that continuing large-scale asset purchases risks placing us in an untenable position, both from the standpoint of unreasonably inflating the stock, bond and other tradable asset markets and from the perspective of complicating the future conduct of monetary policy.
> 
> The eye of the needle of pulling off a clean exit is narrow; the camel is already too fat. As soon as feasible, we should change tack. We should stop digging. I plan to cast my votes at FOMC meetings accordingly.

After the release of the abysmal employment numbers I stated that it was too early to judge whether the Fed would be derailed from their implicit tapering schedule. I was wrong. We have now had three Governors make speeches _after the number_, and all three have signalled that the tapering is still on. I think the safe bet is to assume that absent a complete collapse in the markets or economy, the Fed _**wants the QE policy to wind down.**_ I had thought they were more data dependant, but I am rethinking that position.

The Fed is aware of the issues of the growing inequality caused by their programs, and I think they want to figure out another way to accomplish their goals.

A new Fed Chairperson, a new Fed policy.

As to how this will affect the financial markets. This entire bull market has been predicated on the theory that either the economy improves, or absent an improvement in the economy, the Fed will print.

Some might argue that the economy is improving, and although I will say it is definitely on the mend, I think it is not improving at a rate where it can justify the current stock market price. This will especially be the case if the bond market backs up due to the withdrawal of the Fed&#8217;s bid. Therefore, I would argue that the stock market is more dependant on the QE program than most believe. We have seen the data that show the outperformance on the days where the Fed completes their purchases. Therefore with less purchases, this relative strength has to be removed.

Ever since the 2008 credit crisis, every time the Fed has stopped their QE program, the economy and market has sagged almost immediately. Maybe this time is different, but given the outsized optimism regarding this &#8220;certainty&#8221; I think it is a cheap risk/reward bet to take from the short side.

I am short, and Fisher and the other Fed Governors&#8217; speeches are only making me more bearish.  But I just need to remember what the Federal Reserve usually does with those too bearish&#8230;<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

**Things that I am watching**
  
**The crash in Japanese tuna prices**

On Tuesday the Japanese announced their biggest trade deficit in quite some time. It was quite shocking and the market proceeded to crush the Yen on the news.

I am concerned that the Japanese economy is actually more unstable than most believe. There are really two schools of thought regarding Japan. The first belongs to those that think that Prime Minister Abe will be able to gently let the air out of the Yen, all the while rebalancing their economy and reshaping their country. Supporters of this school of thought believe that Japanese equities are a great way to take advantage of this transformation. The second school of thought, something I will call the Kyle Bass school, believes that the Japanese are&#8230; to be technical&#8230; screwed. They simply have too much debt, with terrible demographics, and that the math foretells their destiny. This group does not advocate being long Japanese equities (although it is interesting in that both groups like being short the currency).

I am not sure which group I belong to, but I guess if I had to pick, I would probably err more on supporting the Kyle Bass school. I am quite concerned that the Japanese economy is undergoing more stressful changes than most market participants understand.

For example, the trade deficit was out of this world bad. Why was that? Who knows, but their entire economy is still suffering from the problems from the nuclear accident.

The Japanese are renown for their blue fin tuna. Every year a big deal is made out of the auction for the largest fish. These fish are over 200 kilograms and in the past have sold for more than 150 million yen per fish! That&#8217;s a little less than $1.50 million US dollars.

This year the fish went for 7.36 million Yen. That&#8217;s right, about $70k. This was a decline of roughly 95%.<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

<img style="display: block; border: 0px;" title="JapanFishJan1414.jpg" alt="JapanFishJan1414" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/01/JapanFishJan1414.jpg" width="600" height="468" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This year&#8217;s most expensive Tuna. 95% off sale from last year!</figcaption></figure> 

This sort of price movement is scary. This is not the kind of anecdotal evidence you want to see.

Maybe I am reading too much into the crashing price of a fish. Maybe, but then again, few were forecasting the persistent deterioration of the trade deficit. Math is math and eventually it catches up with everyone.  The price of the tuna might be more indicative of the true problems that the Japanese economy is facing than anyone realizes.

**Positions**

**UPDATE: Short S&P 500 into strength.  **Shorted half of my position into the strength yesterday.  I am looking for another up day and will short the other half today.  But I still believe the trend has changed.  Conviction: 4

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities. Conviction level: 4. No stop for now.

**Short Canadian dollar.** CAD continues to quietly sink.  Conviction level: 4. Stops to come.  **Short CAD against JPY and EUR.**  Small position size.

**Long various natural gas contracts.** These are much closer in expiry as the curve does not &#8220;earn you carry&#8221; the way crude oil does. This position has had a decent little run with the cold weather. Conviction level: 3 No hard stop but will look to sell a portion at any hint of weakness.

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Short JGB futures.** I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** I am long bond market volatility as I think the next crisis will start in the bond market. Conviction level: 3.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 6
