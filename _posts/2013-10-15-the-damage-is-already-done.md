A couple of weeks ago I speculated that we were about to enter one of the longest government shutdowns that we had experienced in many years. At the time, everyone was feeling bubbly with all the non-taper euphoria and were not much in the mood for listening to some cranky old bugger in the corner who was muttering to himself about the looming problems.

Since then the tone has shifted and the &#8216;certainty&#8217; that the US government would never default has morphed into a &#8216;hope&#8217; that they won&#8217;t.

Over the last week, the markets have been zinging around &#8211; reacting violently to each headline out of Washington. The day to day gyrations of the market are difficult to analyze and predict. It makes sense that the moves are so violent as there is no doubt that it is difficult to price the very unlikely chance of a default since the probability is so low, yet the consequence so high. 

Many US politicians are using this market fear as a way to increase their bargaining power. That is why we have seen the White House actively trying to instil worry into the markets. The closer we get to the brink, the more likely the other side is going to cave as the public widely views the GOP as the obstructionists. 

Politicians are incorrectly assuming that as long as they don&#8217;t actually default, then there is very little cost to this sort of brinksmanship.

However, they are making a grave error.

Let&#8217;s imagine for a second that you are the bank manager of a small branch in mid town America. As the bank manager, you are responsible for handing out credit. Over the years you had gotten to know Bobby and Peggy who were the homecoming King & Queen in high school. Bobby played college football and then after blowing out his knee, returned back to his hometown as a hero to start a car dealership. He was quite successful and throughout the decades, parlayed it into a little small town business empire with a few Kentucky Fried Chickens and a Taco Bell. They have the biggest house in town and they are the envy of the whole neighbourhood. They have a lot of debt, but their assets are quite extensive. A year ago, as the bank branch manager, you were quite happy to write a big loan for Bobby & Peggy to buy a monster retirement house in Palm Beach Florida. However, lately Bobby&#8217;s drinking and hunting has been taking a toll on their marriage. Not only that, he is being intolerant towards his immigrant staff and his latest stunt of throwing his newly announced pregnant daughter out of the house has been the final straw for Peggy. Since she has dual signing authority over their entire affairs, she threatens to stop servicing the debt on the Palm Beach house unless Bobby smartens up.

Now you are not worried about Bobby and Peggy actually paying &#8211; you know that they have a lot of assets and that you will eventually get their money. However, the last thing you want is to get involved in a messy family dispute. Like any good small town banker that knows his place, you watch quietly from the sidelines. Eventually Bobby goes to counselling, starts to be nicer to his staff, gives up hunting and reconciles with his daughter. A year later the couple come to you for a loan to upgrade their Palm Beach house with a new wing for their expanding family. 

At this point, you are forced to decide on a rate for the loan. Whereas before the incident you were happy to give them a loan well below prime because of the safety of their credit, you recall the messy family situation and realize that although this problem has cleared up for now, it is by no means never going to resurface. So instead of giving a loan below prime, you account for this new risk by telling them their loan is at prime.

The same thing is going to happen to the US. The Americans can only pull this crap so often before the rest of the world starts to demand a higher interest rate. At the margin, the damage from this stunt has already been done. 

These two weeks have been way more costly than any US politician realizes. You don&#8217;t mess around with the spectre of default. It is not the sort of idea that you want to put into the minds of your creditors. And for those that think it will be easily forgotten, it is like going to a nude beach and seeing your 75 year Uncle Louie playing volleyball &#8211; it is not something you can easily &#8220;unforget&#8221; (as much as you might want to).

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the odds still favour a deal &#8211; but that will be little solace for the long term state of the US finances &#8211; the damage is already done.
