In the past month there seems to be an awful lot of noise running through the financial media.  W<span style="line-height: 1.6em">ill the Fed taper their QE purchases?  Is the economy rolling over? Do we have a bubble in risk assets?  There is always a fair amount of uncertainty, but there is an above average amount of very divisive opinions right now.</span>

In times like these, I find it useful to take a step back and try to imagine myself in the role of Ben Bernanke and think about his mandate, and what his options actually are.

So let&#8217;s first take the problem that seems to be garnering the most attention in the financial media &#8211; the problem of potential financial asset bubbles.  There is no doubt that many market watchers are concerned that the Fed&#8217;s extremely loose monetary policy is causing significant distortions in the market and potentially causing asset bubbles.  On Bloomberg TV the bond king himself, Bill Gross said:

> <span>&#8220;</span>**We see bubbles everywhere, and that is not to be dramatic and not to suggest they will pop immediately.  <span>I just suggested in the bond market with a bubble in treasuries and bubble in narrow credit spreads and high-yield prices, that perhaps there is a significant distortion there. Having said that, it suggests that as long as the FED and Bank of Japan and other Central Banks keep writing checks and do not withdraw, then the bubble can be supported as in blowing bubbles.  </span>****They are blowing bubbles. When that stops there will be repercussions.  <span>It doesn&#8217;t mean something like 2008 but the potential end of the bull markets everywhere. Not just in the bond market but in the stock market as well and a developing one in the house market as well.&#8221;</span>
  
>** 

I think that Bill&#8217;s opinion pretty well summarizes the sophisticated smart money crowd&#8217;s concern about asset bubbles.

However, let&#8217;s go back to putting ourselves in Ben Bernanke&#8217;s shoes.  Your mandate is to foster economic growth and maintain price stability.  In terms of economic growth, you have made some strides, but the recovery has been the most anemic recovery in post WWII history.  Not only that,  the last two months have seen the global economy roll over unexpectedly.  As Chairman you might be extremely sympathetic to Bill Gross&#8217; arguments, but that is not really your problem.  And as the reputed foremost scholar on the Great Depression, you understand full well how tenuous this recovery is, and how quickly we could sink back into recession.  So, as Fed Chairman you might make some obligatory remarks feigning concern about the increased amount of speculation, but the last thing you are going to do is tighten policy because of an unquantifiable anecdotal worry about asset bubbles.  Therefore when Ben Bernanke gave his recent speech highlighting his concerns about investors reaching for yield, remember that this is simply Ben CYA&#8217;ng in case things eventually do blow up in his face.  **There is absolutely no reason for Bernanke to preemptively tighten monetary policy due to increased speculation.**  Yes, he would prefer the market to not get frothy and for the loose money to focus itself into the real economy, but he knows that this is a most likely side effect of his policies.

The low possibility of the Fed Chairman tightening policy is especially true given that his other half of the mandate, to maintain price stability, is actually falling (at least in the way he measures it).  Have a look at the Year over Year Core PCE measure:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/PCE%20YoY%20May%2017%2013.gif" />

Inflation is plummeting and is significantly below his mandated 2% target rate.  Not only that, he has already stated that he would be willing to tolerate even higher rates of inflation for brief periods in an effort to foster economic growth.

So let&#8217;s think about it.  The economy is weak and appears to be getting weaker.  Inflation is low and seems to be going lower.  Is this the kind of environment that the Fed tightens policy?  Not a chance.  The Fed has their mandate, and unless that mandate is changed to include protecting against asset bubbles, there is no reason to justify changing monetary policy.   A<span style="line-height: 1.6em">lthough Ben & Co. can warn about future policy tightening and also make changes to increase their flexibility in terms of navigating the exit, there is slim reason to expect the Fed to change policy.</span>

The market is confused because they are being inundated with recent speeches by various Fed Governors that have highlighted the desire to taper QE purchases, or even stop them in the coming months.

Although I do think the excessively easy monetary policy is a disaster in the making, I ask you &#8211; when has the Fed ever gotten out in front of an asset bubble and choked off the problem by raising rates.  The answer of course is never.  To assume this time will be different is wishful thinking.  They can talk about tapering all they want &#8211; until I actually see them do it, I am going to assume that it is purely talk.

The Fed will not deviate from their mandate of fostering economic growth and maintaining price stability as they define it.  Given that both of these inputs are headed the wrong way, the excessively easy monetary policy will continue.  As the famous army expression goes &#8211; &#8216;the beatings will continue until moral improves.&#8217;

This will undoubtedly create asset bubbles, but if you put yourself in Ben Bernanke&#8217;s shoes, how can he do anything else given his mandate?  If he deviates and it goes badly, Congress and the American public would hang him in a lynch mob.  If he stays the course with excessively easy policy and it creates a massive asset bubble, at least he can say that he was following his mandate.  Ask yourself, are you ready to tighten just because asset markets are getting frothy?  Are you really ready to let Wall Street affect your decisions that will send millions of more Americans out of work?  Yes, it might be the long run correct decision, but it is extremely hard to tighen rates into this sort of back drop.  It is the wrong bet to assume that Bernanke will do so.

Don&#8217;t over think this.  The Fed will follow their mandate.  Don&#8217;t get distracted by the rhetoric.  They will overshoot and create a massive bubble.  It will eventually end badly, but eventually can be a long, long ways away.
