I have been meaning to write this piece for over a month now, but every time I sat down to start there was a little voice inside my head that was warning that it was too early.   However during this latest commodity sell off, the speculators have pitched this position as well, leading to a much better risk reward long entry.

This trade that I have been reluctant to mention is to buy uranium and the associated uranium companies.

I have no idea which uranium companies to buy, so I like to focus on the closed end uranium fund Uranium Participation Corp (U CN Equity) that trades on the TSX.  I would love to trade futures instead, but unfortunately that market has never really taken off, so I am forced to trade this fund as a proxy.

I am not going to go through all the big picture uranium bull arguments.  They are easy enough to google and if you want specifics, have a look at the [World Nuclear Association](http://www.world-nuclear.org).  If you believe that in the long run there are alternative mass energy sources for an ever growing global population, then just stop reading this right now and go invest in those companies.  However, if you believe that in the long run, it will be very difficult for nuclear energy to not be a major a source of energy, then feel free to continue with my analysis.

There is no doubt that the Japanese disaster was a big set back for those who espouse nuclear energy as a safe and environmentally friendly source of energy.  I am not going to argue about whether nuclear energy is safe or the proper course of development for our growing energy thirsty world &#8211; it might or it might not be.  However, this argument is pretty well moot because China and other developing nations are on a path of increased nuclear development regardless of what we think.

Although there won&#8217;t be any new nuclear power plants built in the United States any time soon, China is scheduled to vastly expand its nuclear generation in the coming decades.  China currently operates 17 reactors.  They have another 29 currently under construction, with another 51 planned.  And finally they have proposed to build an additional 120!  Currently China relies on coal for its electricity production and the environmental effects of this type of energy are disastrous.  We have all heard about the terrible pollution that is enveloping the major Chinese cities.  It is a complete disaster and everyone recognizes that having entire cities resembling the back room of an illegal gambling den is no way for a population to live.  So like it or not, China is going to convert from coal to nuclear.  The Japanese disaster is not going to derail their long term shift.

Although the Japanese disaster is going to do very little to change the long term demand for uranium, it has had a tremendous impact on the short and medium run.  Japan, which was 5th biggest user of uranium, shut down all of their reactors.  This upset the demand/supply balance and sent prices dramatically lower.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/Uranium%20Price%20Apr%2022%2013.png" />

Since then the market has been extremely worried that not only has the Japanese demand being removed from the market, but that they would actually turn into net sellers of their stock piled uranium.

However, even though it is not a popular position in Japan, Prime Minister Abe is trying to restart the reactors.  I believe he understands that in the long run, the resource poor Japan cannot afford to input expensive liquified natural gas for its energy needs.  I am not an expert in Japanese politics and not really qualified to speak about what his chances are, but I do know that the price of uranium has very little speculation about Japanese restarting of the reactors built into the price.  If it happens, then it will be a plus.  If it doesn&#8217;t happen, I don&#8217;t think it changes a thing.

So what will cause the price of uranium to head back higher?  Over the last couple of decades there has been a program called &#8220;Megatons to Megawatts Program&#8221; which recycled Russian nuclear warheads into a source of usable nuclear energy.  Since 1995 they have converted almost 19,000 nuclear warheads into reactor fuel.  This has been a major source of supply for the uranium market during this period.  This program is set to expire at the end of 2013.

Although I am concerned that there might be a little too many hedge funds who are trying to front run the decreased supply, in the grand scheme of things, uranium is currently suffering from a &#8216;not in my portfolio&#8217; for most investors.  The disaster of Japan is simply still too fresh in their minds.

Uranium is unloved, forgotten and abandoned.  At the same time, the big picture demand/supply picture is unchanged and if anything, the increased Chinese pollution problems have only accelerated their move to nuclear energy.

In the long run, we have an increase in the level of demand (China and other emerging markets), combined with a decrease in the amount of supply (megaton for megawatts program termination).

There was a time when speculators drove uranium to many multiples of today&#8217;s price.  Have a look at the long term chart:

I believe that this level of $40 offers long term support and you should be building positions into today&#8217;s apathy.

Which brings me to the Uranium Participation Fund (U CN Equity).  This is a closed end fund that was brought to market eight years ago.  The fund&#8217;s only mandate is to hold uranium.  Due to the fact that uranium is not a deliverable commodity, this fund&#8217;s premium/discount to the net asset value can swing quite wildly with no ability to arbitrage.  It is therefore extremely sensitive to investor sentiment towards uranium.

At one point, the fund traded at a 150% premium to NAV.  However, since then the fund has fallen out of favour and the premium/discount has collapsed all the way down to a 23% discount after the Japanese disaster.  Have a look at the long term chart of the Premium/Discount to NAV:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/U%20PREM%20LT%20Apr%2022%2013.gif" />

Let&#8217;s assume that the 150% premium was stupid noise and let&#8217;s examine the trading over the last couple of years a little more closely:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/U%20PREM%20ST%20Apr%2022%2013.gif" />

You will notice that the discount narrowed methodically over the last year, moving from 23% to almost 0% a month ago.

Which brings me back to why I have been hesitant to pull the trigger on the purchase.   I believe that this narrowing of the discount has been due to the increased interest by hedge funds.  I am always nervous when too many hedge funds have the same idea as me, so I have been reluctant to aggressively hop on this uranium bandwagon.

However, I think this recent move lower is the opportunity that I have been waiting for.  Nothing has changed in the uranium market, yet the Uranium Participation Fund has gone from $5.65 down to $4.90 over the last month:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/U%20CN%20Equity%20Apr%2022%2013.gif" />

This is purely hedge fund liquidation.  Nothing more, nothing less.

I am willing to take a little off their hands at a 10% discount to NAV.  I am starting this position and believe that not only will NAV head higher in the coming months, but that we will eventually be selling this closed end fund at a significant premium to NAV as sentiment changes.

What&#8217;s that great expression?  Buy your straw hats in winter.  Let&#8217;s start our hat collection today.
