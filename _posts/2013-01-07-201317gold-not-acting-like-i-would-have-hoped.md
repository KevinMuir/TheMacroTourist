[Late in December I posted a theory](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2012/12/21/buying-the-goldsp-500-ratio) that gold was trading poorly because of the upcoming change in the capital gain tax rate.  At the time I suggested that a good way to play this weakness was to buy the gold/S&P 500 ratio.

That trade worked for about a week, but has now rolled over into new lows.

Although I am a big believer in the fact that the Federal Reserve is going to print aggressively in the next couple of quarters, I do not think that gold is necessarily the best way to play this reflation.

I was hoping for a technical bounce due to year end selling finishing, but since gold is not behaving as I expected, I am flattening the trade.

### Why is gold trading so poorly?

There are not a lot of good reasons for the poor performance of gold over the last couple of months, which makes me all the more worried.

It has been up every year for the last decade, so I guess to assume that remarkable performance will continue unabated forever is probably a little naive.

I am of the belief that simply too many hedge funds have too large a position in gold.  I hate to own something that all the hedge funds are stuffed to the gills with.  When they sell, they all seem to go together and it makes for a very difficult trading environment.

So I am officially returning to the &#8220;no opinion&#8221; camp on gold.   There are easier trades out there.
