This morning, for the first time in a long while, gold has rallied at the start of the NY session.

I have written about how sentiment for gold is about as terrible as it gets.  I don&#8217;t want to goocher it, but this might be the start of a new pattern for gold.

Maybe, just maybe, the selling is all done?

For those that are not yet long, all I can say is &#8211; &#8220;come on in!  The water&#8217;s fine!&#8221;
