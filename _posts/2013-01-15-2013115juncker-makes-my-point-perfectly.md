In my previous post I speculated that countries were going to be increasingly looking after their own interests in a massive race to devalue.

Jean-Claude Junker, who speaks for the group of Euro area finance ministers,  just made my point perfectly with his recent statement:

> &#8220;The euro foreign exchange rate is dangerously high.&#8221;

Really?  Dangerously high?

The euro must have experienced some massive appreciation to warrant a comment like that.  Let&#8217;s go to the chart to confirm Juncker&#8217;s view:

This chart certainly does not seem to warrant Juncker&#8217;s aggressive comment.

The race to the bottom has begun.  Trade accordingly.
