The US unemployment numbers were released this morning and they were terrible. &nbsp;&nbsp;

I am busy trading, so I don&#8217;t want to spend too long writing &#8211; but I did want to post this &#8211; don&#8217;t over think this!

Lately the stock market has been going up and bonds have been getting hammered, but this just gives you a much better entry.

I am long bonds and short stocks and today&#8217;s number just reinforces my conviction that it is the high probability trade.
