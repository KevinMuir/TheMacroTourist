I distinctly remember the pain of being bullish in 2012 and having the trade go against me for quite some time.   The prevailing wisdom was that the Fed was pushing on a string and that any stimulus would be ineffective and therefore bonds were the only place to invest.  I looked over at my partners and told them, &#8220;don&#8217;t worry, before you know it I will be short and complaining about all the knobs who are chasing it into new highs.&#8221;

<span style="line-height: 1.6em">Well, that day has arrived. </span>

I know that markets make opinions and not the other way around, but I am continually amazed at how most investors asset forecasts are nothing more than an extrapolation of the last 3 months.

Let&#8217;s have a quick review of the performance of some asset classes for the Year to Date (from Capital Spectator):

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/ReadKit%20Aug%2013%2013.jpg" />

Like sheep, investors are now chasing what has worked during the last few months instead of diversifying into other beaten down assets.

Have a look at the equity fund flows:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/520a5d1ae4b01247d70eb768/1376410907921/ICI-NetEquity-Inflows-072513.PNG" />

After selling stocks relentlessly for the last 5 years (apart from a small period in 2011 that corresponded with an interim top) , the public has now decided that it might be a <span style="line-height: 1.6em">good time to put some money to work in the stock market.  </span>

Predictable, yet so sad.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/6bc3f86727374e056543fd951ca6734a.jpeg" />

Now, what is even more predictable is how guys like me are going to be early and fight this trend for way too long, making our lives way more miserable than they have to be.

The 1990s Dot Con bubble made fools of some very smart guys who looked like Chicken Littles for a long time before they were finally exonerated.  Then the 2000s credit bubble did the same for a new batch of supposedly smart guys until they too were finally redeemed.

So when I tell you I am short and fighting it, you need to remember that I could be very, very wrong.  In fact, probably the best sign that of when it is actually is due to roll over is when I give up.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/520a5ffee4b03ad27aba97db/1376411650806/Chinas-Dead-Sea-1%20Aug%2013%2013pngChinas-Dead-Sea-1%20Aug%2013%2013png?format=original" />

However, I refuse to climb aboard the &#8216;come on in, the water is fine&#8217; crowd that is piling into equities.  I will acknowledge that we might on the cusp of a reflation, but I think there are much better ways to play that then joining the masses in their stock market chasing.  (I will develop this idea of alternative asset classes that will benefit better from this reflation in future posts)

But in the mean time, let&#8217;s step back and take a moment to reflect on where the stock market has been, and then ask ourselves if this is really the time to chase it higher.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/SPX%20Aug%2013%2013.gif" />

I know that there are a lot of reasonable arguments about why stocks are reasonably valued.  Have a look at this great chart Ritholz published recently:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/520a62f1e4b03374244300cc/1376412403042/SP-500-Valuation-Metrics%20Aug%2013%2013.png" />

Stocks look neither stupidly expensive or absurdly cheap.  Why wouldn&#8217;t you buy them then?

Most of these metrics are based on an earnings assumption that is discounted by an interest rate.

Let&#8217;s have a quick look at both of those variables.  First here is the earnings expressed as the Corporate Profits as a percent of GDP:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/fredgraph%201%20Aug%2013%2013.png" />

Now maybe corporate profits continue to rise from here.  Who knows?  I certainly don&#8217;t.  But a quick glance at that chart leads me to say that the risks are that the recent rise is not sustainable.  Especially when you consider this next chart &#8211; which is the wages of workers as a percent of GDP:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/520a64f0e4b019bfc9dcc68f/1376412913059/W270RE1A156NBEA_Max_630_378.png" />

When you think about the interest rate that these models discount these projected earnings, it doesn&#8217;t offer much more comfort:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/USG%2010%20Ye%20Aug%2013%2013.gif" />

Again do you think the risks are skewed towards this number being higher or lower going forward?

So although I respect the reasons that investors might be rationalizing their purchase of equities, I really think they are doing nothing more than rotating out the risk curve in a massive game of chase what&#8217;s been working.

Then consider what some smart wise guys are doing:

> _&#8220;It&#8217;s almost biblical. There is a time to reap and there&#8217;s a time to sow,&#8221; Leon Black, chairman and chief executive of Apollo Global Management (ticker: APO) declared to the Milken Institute&#8217;s global conference in Los Angeles, alluding to that same Scriptural passage. &#8220;We are harvesting,&#8221; he added pointedly._

> _That is, the private-equity giant is a net seller because things simply can&#8217;t get much better. &#8220;We think it&#8217;s a fabulous environment to be selling,&#8221; he says, noting Apollo has sold about $13 billion in assets in the past 15 months. &#8220;We&#8217;re selling everything that&#8217;s not nailed down. And if we&#8217;re not selling, we&#8217;re refinancing.&#8221;_

> _That&#8217;s because there has never been such a good time to borrow &#8212; which is raising warning flags for Black. &#8220;The financing market is as good as we have ever seen it. It&#8217;s back to 2007 levels. There is no institutional memory,&#8221; he observed, referring to the peak of the last credit bubble._

<p class="p1">
  Howard Marks is a little more diplomatic, but he is definitely also warning about getting over confident:
</p>

> As an investor, he looks for extremes in confidence between &#8216;too much&#8217; and &#8216;too little.&#8217;  Investors often become overconfident after things have been good for a while, and they become extremely negative when it seems there&#8217;s no hope in sight.  Investors, he says, should do the opposite:

> &#8220;When most investors are driven to drop their prudence by an excess of confidence, we should be terrified.  In the same way, when most investors become devoid of confidence and flee the market, we should turn aggressive.&#8221;

> Why should you care what Marks has to say?  Well for one, he always offers insightful tidbits and words of wisdom in his letters.  And secondly, Warren Buffett himself has said he loves to read Marks&#8217; missives.  And what Marks is saying is really just another version of Buffett&#8217;s famous: &#8220;be greedy when others are fearful.&#8221;

> &#8220;As I wrote in <span class="s1" style="line-height: 1.6em"><a style="line-height: 1.6em" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231162847/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=markfoll-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0231162847">my book</a></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em">, when there&#8217;s nothing clever to do, the mistake lies in trying to be clever.  Today it seems the best we can do is invest prudently in the coming months, avoiding aggressiveness and remembering to apply caution.&#8221;</span>

Or how about Bill Gross who summed it all up perfectly with this tweet?

> Gross: So [<span class="s1">#QE</span>](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23QE) 1, 2 & 3 lifted stock prices by nearly unanimous agreement. When the [<span class="s1">#Fed</span>](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23Fed) [<span class="s1">#tapers</span>](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23tapers), stocks will keep climbing?

> — PIMCO (@PIMCO) [<span class="s1">August 7, 2013</span>](https://twitter.com/PIMCO/statuses/365112323607760896)

Now just because these guys are getting worried does not mean that you shouldn&#8217;t decide that the coast is clear and invest in stocks.  We all know things were really bad in 2008 and that was definitely not a good time to invest.  Now that things are finally looking better in 2013 it might be a good time to put a little extra money to work in the market.

My pathetic attempt at sarcasm will probably be missed on some.

I really shouldn&#8217;t be surprised by this stock market action.  After all, as Jessie Livermore said;

> “There is never anything new on Wall Street, because speculation is as old as the hills.”

Jessie did not believe in fighting the trend, so he probably wouldn&#8217;t be as stupid as me in shorting this rally, but I just can&#8217;t bring myself around to giving up yet.
