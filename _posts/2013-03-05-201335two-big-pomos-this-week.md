Zero Hedge loves to point out the fact that the Federal Reserve is often in the market conducting POMO (Permanent Open Market Operations) and that you shouldn&#8217;t short on any day that the Fed is buying.  The trouble with that theory is that the Fed is almost in the market each and every day.

I have done a little more in depth [analysis](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2012/12/7/pomo-effect-revisited.html) and concluded that the size of the POMO matters (that&#8217;s what she said).

Given that fact, I would like to highlight that we have **two very large POMOs this week.**  One today and one on Thursday.  I would be extremely careful with any shorts and would err on assuming that any dips will be shallow.

It is hard to buy a market that is screaming to new highs on poor fundamentals, but this might be a case where it is safe to pull a Chuck Prince and keep dancing a little while the music still plays.  On the trading side I will be a little quicker with the blue tickets and try to keep the pinks in my drawer until later in the week.  I think the risk reward favours trading with a long bias for a few days.
