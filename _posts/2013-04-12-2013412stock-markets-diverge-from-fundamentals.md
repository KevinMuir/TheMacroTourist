Non-market regular folks always find the concept of what causes stocks to go up and down baffling. &nbsp;Understanding &#8216;what is built in&#8217; to the price is the most difficult for them. &nbsp;When a company announces terrible earnings that are not as bad as expectations, the regular folk get bewildered on why the stock rises. &nbsp;&#8216;But the earnings were terrible!&#8217; they will say. &nbsp;At the same time, they have no clue how when the earnings are terrific, if the stock has fully priced in that good news, it will still sell off. &nbsp;

When it comes to the stock market as a whole, it is even more difficult to understand what drives the price movements. &nbsp;Sometimes bad economic news means you should buy stocks, other times it means you should sell. &nbsp;Sometimes inflation is good, other times it is bad. &nbsp;It seems almost random to most people.

The market&#8217;s performance over the last couple of weeks is one of those times when it is difficult to explain. &nbsp;

There is no doubt that the economy is slowing and maybe even rolling over. &nbsp;This morning we had more terrible economic news.

At a certain point of the cycle bad economic news is very stock friendly because it means that although the economy is slowing, the Federal Reserve is about to get easier, which will cause interest rates to decline, thus making stocks more attractive. &nbsp;During this era of monetary ZIRP madness, the easing takes the form of Quantitative Easing. &nbsp;So sometimes bad economic numbers means an increase in the chance that the Fed engages in more QE, making stocks all the more attractive. &nbsp;I understand that and have no problem with the logic that bad economic news equals higher stocks in that environment.

However, we are not in that environment. &nbsp;Does anyone really think that economic weakness over the next 6 months is going to cause the Fed to get even more aggressive? &nbsp;I don&#8217;t think the Fed can realistically buy anymore than they are buying without causing massive scary distortions in the market. &nbsp;In practical terms, all that the Fed can realistically do in the next year is not stop their current QE monthly trajectory.

So therefore economic weakness does not mean more stimulus. &nbsp;Logically stocks should not go up on the bad news.

But you might say, &#8216;maybe stocks are seeing through the weakness.&#8217; &nbsp;That is true, stocks very well might be looking past this blip and say the weakness is temporary. &nbsp;However at what point does the &#8216;temporary&#8217; weakness become more permanent? &nbsp;Eventually the stock market will not be able to continue with its delusion.

But why are they even trying to &#8216;look through&#8217; the weakness? &nbsp;Why aren&#8217;t stocks doing a better job at discounting the possibility that the economy is about to roll over?</p> </p> 

One word &#8211; Abeconomics. &nbsp;Japan&#8217;s massive liquidity surge is being felt all throughout the globe. &nbsp;The money is being forced into risk assets, and it doesn&#8217;t matter that the long term prospects are becoming dimmer, something must be bought.

This is a very scary development as stocks are rising regardless of fundamentals. &nbsp;

It is becoming increasingly clear that the Fed&#8217;s recent Quantitative Easing program is not having the intended effect on the economy. &nbsp;Although no one is really talking about this, **it appears as if the Fed is indeed pushing on a string.** &nbsp;I am shocked that this fact is not becoming recognized by the market. &nbsp;The Fed&#8217;s ability to stimulate from here is quite limited and the economy is rolling over. &nbsp;There is no real backstop for the economy. &nbsp;Japan&#8217;s liquidity might help the Nikkei, but it is going to do nothing for the US economy. &nbsp;In fact it is probably at the margin negative for the US economy as Japan will suddenly be able to much better compete against American products for the dwindling consumer dollar.

Printed dollars are chasing risky assets regardless of the increasing risk. &nbsp;

Eventually asset prices reflect fundamental value. &nbsp;It might take a while, months and even maybe even years, but eventually everything reverts to fundamental value. &nbsp;Right now the probability adjusted fundamental value of stocks is declining, yet the liquidity wave is dragging them higher. &nbsp; 

This has created a divergence where it makes sense to start shorting all stock markets, not just Europe. &nbsp;I suspect we are going to see more and more economists / market strategists start to question to durability of this economic upswing and when they figure out that there is very limited further easing that the Federal Reserve can do in the short run, they will realize that stocks are extremely risky at these price levels.</p>
