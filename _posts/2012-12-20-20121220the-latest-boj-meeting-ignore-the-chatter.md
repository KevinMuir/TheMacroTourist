<p class="p2">
  Last night the BOJ met and it was a slight disappointment for the new found Japan bears who were hoping for a more aggressive adoption of the increased inflation targets that newly elected Prime Minister Abe campaigned on.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  If you read Zero Hedge, Tyler Durden made it sound like the end of the world in terms of the bear thesis falling apart due to the inaction of the BOJ.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  I agree that Japan has a long history of a couple of decades of disappointments from governments who promised that this time they will truly fix the problem. I understand the skepticism.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  However, letâ€™s step back and think about this latest BOJ meeting. The newly elected government has <strong>not yet been sworn into office.</strong> Is it realistic to expect a Central Bank to dramatically change their policies based on the fact that a politician made a campaign promise to alter the inflation target? Not a chance. Anyone who was expecting the BOJ to dramatically alter their course before being given <strong>explicit marching orders</strong> from the government is not thinking this through realistically.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Now, they very well might indeed keep up their long history of falling down, but this is <strong>way too soon</strong> to make a judgement.
</p>

Ignore the market chatter about this latest BOJ meeting. The next one towards the end of January is what really matters.</p>
