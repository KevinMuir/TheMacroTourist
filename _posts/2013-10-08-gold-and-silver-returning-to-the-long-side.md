I am not a huge technical chart guy, so when I start to bring up technical levels, you should probably ignore the rest of the post.

However, I do believe that one simple chart pattern occurs with consistency on many different time frames. Markets often retrace the 38% to 62% of the move before continuing along. 

It is no surprise to me that gold recently retraced 62% of the move from the lows we made in July:

Silver was not quite as &#8216;perfect&#8217;, but the chart is almost the same:

Given that these levels have held, suggesting that the longer trend is up, I am climbing back aboard my long position in both commodities. 

I don&#8217;t want to over think this. I believe a bottom was made this summer and that the next move is higher. Nothing more complicated than that. The market action seems to be confirming that point of view and this seems like a reasonable spot to re-enter the trade.
