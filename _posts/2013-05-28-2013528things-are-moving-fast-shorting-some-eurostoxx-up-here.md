This morning we are getting a very emotional rally in the stock market accompanied by a big move lower in bonds.

I am long tons of bond volatility and also just outright short bonds.

I am going to put on a quasi hedge by shorting some EuroStoxx futures up here. Â I know that is far from a perfect hedge, but I am nervous that the bond backup is going to affect stocks negatively for the short run.

Things are moving fast and I am worried that this rally in stocks is going to prove fleeting.
