Yesterday&#8217;s FOMC decision to taper also included a shift in the committee&#8217;s commitment to hold rates exceptionally low:

> To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. The Committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee&#8217;s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee now anticipates, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee&#8217;s 2 percent longer-run goal. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

This extended commitment was designed to soften the blow of the QE reduction and shift the Fed&#8217;s attempt to stimulate the economy from direct means (QE asset purchases) to indirect means (commitment to hold rates low). 

If the market believed the Fed&#8217;s commitment, this shift in policy should have had the effect of flattening the front of the Federal Funds futures curve. The Fed&#8217;s message was basically; yes we are reducing the amount of bonds that we are going to buy next month, but we are coupling that with a promise to leave rates lower for a little bit of extra time. Although you would expect the longer dated yield curve to steepen on this announcement, you would expect the next couple of years of Fed Fund futures to flatten.

However, the exact opposite has happened:

You will notice that the Fed Funds future curve from two days ago (the yellow line) is actually lower than today&#8217;s curve (the green line). 

**_The market has priced in an earlier rate hike from the Fed &#8211; just the opposite of what they intended to signal!_**

The market has also flattened the US longer dated Treasury curve. Here is the 5-30 year spread:

Again, this is not what the Federal Reserve was hoping for. 

Even the break even rates sagged yesterday:

The market has completely focused on the lowering of the asset purchases and ignored the change in commitment to low rates.

This is resulting in a tightening of financial conditions &#8211; something that panicked the Fed into not tapering the previous time. This is best illustrated by the fact that the US dollar has been steadily rallying since the announcement:

Sometimes markets take a little bit of time to get the direction right. Maybe they just need to digest the Fed&#8217;s recent move and that this two day knee jerk reaction will just be some noise as they figure it out.

However, if this trend continues, the Fed&#8217;s attempt to cushion the taper through changes in their commitment to keep rates low will have been a failure, and most importantly, will do little to suggest that they will be able to taper further. 

The Fed needs to be able to withdraw their direct support, so they better hope that the market accepts their indirect support shift. **So far though it has been a big disappointment, and a big problem for the Fed.**
