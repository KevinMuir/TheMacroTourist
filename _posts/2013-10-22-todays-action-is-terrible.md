Today&#8217;s action in the stock market is terrible. 

We had the delayed Unemployment number release, and it was just gawd-awful. This was the last release that was not affected by the government shutdown, so there was a lot of anticipation from market participants for analyzing a &#8216;clean&#8217; number.

It turns out that Bernanke & Co. were on to something when they decided to post pone the taper. It is now clear that the economy had already turned downward and now with the government shutdown thrown into the mix, any hope for a quick economic rebound is probably out of the question.

The stock market took the unemployment news to mean &#8216;QE forever&#8217; and initially shot the market straight up.

The Nasdaq in particular was strong because one of my Four Horsemen, Netflix, had recorded blow out numbers the night before. NFLX had gapped higher and opened at an all time high &#8211; up 10% on the day.

However, that NFLX gap was quickly met with very aggressive selling. NFLX has given up all of its gains and is now trading down on the day:

Here is the trading for the last three days:

This is very disconcerting and the bulls should be very worried about this action.

Since the budget settlement we have been riding a wave of stock market euphoria, and although I have been getting cautious, I have not been short very much.

Today&#8217;s action has emboldened me to press my foot down on some short positions.

I would probably do it with NDX futures as they look the most vulnerable:
