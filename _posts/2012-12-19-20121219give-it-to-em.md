One of my buddies emailed me yesterday about my [previous post](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2012/12/18/the-word-of-the-day-unlimited).  He thought it was strange that I was bearish on bonds, even though the Fed was about to embark on a massive quantitative easing program.

The prevailing wisdom about QE is that it lowers interest rates.  This morning on Bloomberg TV I heard Adam Parker, the head strategist for Morgan Stanley say something to the effect of  &#8220;[the Fed] buys our government bonds, which will keep yields low through 2013”.  I think this type of thinking is just plain wrong.

What is the goal of Quantitative Easing?  The politically correct line to spout is that QE is meant to keep interest rates low to encourage economic activity.  But let’s put political correctness aside and just say out loud what everyone knows to be true &#8211; the goal of QE is to increase inflation (or at the very least, to stop deflation from embedding itself into our economy).  There is nothing that scares Bernanke & Co. more than a self reinforcing deflationary spiral.  In an over indebted economy, deflation only increases the real burden of that debt.  Therefore above all else, the Federal Reserve wants to make sure there is enough inflation to not allow the debt burden to grow due to deflation.  This is the main goal of QE.

When the Federal Reserve engages in Quantitative Easing, they are expanding their balance sheet.  They buy bonds from the Primary Dealers, paying for them by “printing” money.  This increases the amount of bank reserves in the system (the Primary Dealers have sold the bonds to the Fed and now have cash in their account), and assuming that the velocity of money is constant, causes the supply of money to increase.

What happens when you increase the supply of money?  You now have more money chasing the same amount of goods and services, thus creating inflation.  Obviously in a global dynamic economy where capital flows around quite easily there are other effects and it is not quite so cut and dry, but that is the basic concept.

What is the effect of inflation on bond prices?  Although based on the mad scramble for bonds by the retail over the last few years I think they might have forgotten this point, i**nflation makes bonds go down.**  Full stop.  End of story.  Inflation is a government bond holders worst nightmare.  (actually default is the worst nightmare, but if a government is a currency issuer, this should not be a consideration)

Therefore, if the Fed is actually successful at achieving their end goal for QE, then the program would be considered bond negative.

Instead of taking my word for it, let’s go look at the actual bond yield chart during some QE programs.  I have made a chart of the 30 year bond yield for QE1 and QE2.  I have not bothered with “Operation Twist” as I do not view that as real quantitative easing as the Fed’s balance sheet did not grow.  If conventional wisdom is correct and that QE causes bond yields to go down, we should see that during the programs, bonds rose in price and yields fell.  At the end of the program we should see the opposite.  Absent the Fed buying, we should see bonds fall back in price and yields rise.

Below is the yield chart for the 30 year US Treasury Bond.  I have boxed QE1 in a red rectangle and QE2 in a green rectangle.

You will notice that during the QE programs yields did not fall.  In fact, you could argue that they rose.

But most important, have a look at what happened once the QE program ended.  Both times the bond market exploded higher (yields fell) after the Federal Reserve stopped buying.

Isn’t that wrong?  Why would bonds yields fall after the Fed stopped buying?  Isn’t the Fed’s QE programs suppose to keep yields low?

No, the Fed’s QE programs are suppose to increase inflation expectations.  If the Fed actually wanted low rates, the best thing they could do would be to stop QE and allow the deflation to set in.  The economy is in a de-leveraging stage that absent the Fed’s balance sheet expansion (and there is a fiscal element to this as well, but right now let’s focus on the monetary side), the economy will enter into a credit destruction phase that would send government bond prices soaring.

Therefore, when strategists tell you that should buy fixed income because the government is engaging in unlimited QE, I think you should think very hard about the consequences of that program.  Don’t forget that when a private sector entity buys bonds, it is usually paying for them by exchanging it for something else &#8211; be it cash, or stocks that were sold, or real estate.  But that transaction has no effect on the supply of money.  When the Fed buys bonds, they are not selling anything to pay for it, but merely expanding their balance sheet.  That balance sheet expansion is ultimately inflationary, which is the very last thing a bond owner wants.  Therefore when the Fed comes for the bonds, my advice is to give it to ‘em.
