I have previously documented how Ithaca Energy&#8217;s management had been aggressively purchasing stock in the open market. Last night IAE released their latest update on management&#8217;s holdings. It appears that there was a whole slew of options that were expiring. However, instead of just exercising, selling the stock and pocketing the whole amount, it looks like management kept as much stock as they could after paying taxes and commissions.

Have a look at the table below which outlines the amount of stock that management has retained:

(By the way, Nicholas Muir is no relation to me &#8211; Muirs are a pretty common name over in Scotland.)

I continue to love this stock. This latest release shows that so does management!
