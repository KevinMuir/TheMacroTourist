Although I have not yet seen the movie, I am half way through the book. And although it is a highly entertaining read, it is actually a sad reflection of the many too many jackasses that permeate our financial industry.

I will leave the moral pontifications to others (and if you have not yet seen the movie, then based on the first half of the book, there will probably be a fair bit to be pontificating about), but I did want to highlight a couple of curious facts about the movie.

The Wolf of Wall Street is actually the second movie to be released under this title. The first wolf was released as a black and white film that starred George Bancroft:

Now that in itself is not that interesting, after all, the Wolf of Wall Street is a pretty great handle. No wonder they made two movies with that as the title.

However, guess when the movie was released? Yup &#8211; you betcha &#8211; 1929, mere months before the greatest crash in stock market history.

The timing could not have been better.

Which reminds me of the last really great Wall Street movie:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/12/WSDec3113.jpg" alt="WSDec3113" title="WSDec3113.jpg" border="0" width="301" height="436" />

Although it was released in December 1987 _after the &#8217;87 crash_, it was by no means a reaction to that dramatic market event, but instead a reflection on the excesses leading up to that point. It was long in the making before there were even any hints about a market crash.

Oliver Stone had written the Gordon Gecko character as a villain, and much to his disdain, he unfortunately became a Wall Street hero. In interviews, the actor who played GG, Michael Douglas, complains all the time about Wall Street idiots who stop him in restaurants, slap him on his back and tell him how much they want to be like Gecko. 

As for our current Wall Street hollywood production, although Scorsese and DiCaprio are quick to point out that the picture is meant to be a satire about Wall Street, I somehow doubt that eager young men desperate to make their mark on the street are going to take it that way.

And even more importantly for us, given the unusual coincidence of these sorts of films being released as the party is coming to a close, I would be very hesitant to view this as even remotely bullish for the equity market. 

They don&#8217;t usually ring a bell at the top, but it sure would be interesting if Leo actually did this time&#8230; (I know it would make my wife a lot more eager to learn about stocks&#8230;)
