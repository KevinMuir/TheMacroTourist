Hello my name is Kevin and I have a problem.  I continually make the mistake of believing that the global economy can achieve escape velocity and that the recovery will become self reinforcing.  I have been abusing for the past three years and I am afraid I am going to lapse again this spring.

They say that admitting you have a problem is the first step on your road to recovery.  Well, I am willing to admit that over the last three years I have found myself with large pro-cyclical macro positions that have worked very well for the first three months of each year.  Sometimes I used long stocks, other times it was short bonds.  I even experimented with long commodities in previous years.  Each time it was the same.  At first everything felt great.  The P&L would have a big huge plus sign.  I would then increase my bet size.  That is what everyone tells you to do.  And it feels so good.

But then each year it happened.  The recovery stalled and the economy rolled over.  One year it was because the Fed tried to slow down its QE program.  Another time it was because Europe lapsed into a credit crisis.  Each time it was slightly different, but basically the same.  The economy was unable to achieve escape velocity.

Have a look at this ISI Company Diffusion chart:

It distinctly shows the rolling over of the economy in the spring of each of the last 3 years.

Putting the kidding aside, I am aware that I have probably being too optimistic about the prospects of these recovery attempts becoming self reinforcing economic expansions. I have indeed given up some very decent hard earned gains each of the last few years as the economy has rolled over in the spring.

This year I am not pushing quite as hard.  I have ridden the same early year updraft, but I am looking to protect my gains a little more this time.  This fact in itself is probably the greatest indicator that this time will indeed be different.

I don&#8217;t have any great insight to add.  I am aware that the Fed seems more committed than in previous springs, and this time we have almost all Central Banks (save for the ECB) aggressively expanding.  One of these times the animal spirits will be unleashed and the monetary expansion will become self reinforcing.  I believe that at that point the Central Bankers of the world will regret the terrible beast that they have unleashed, but in the mean time, I am weary of making the same mistake as previous years.

  God grant me the serenity<br /> to accept the things I cannot change;<br /> courage to change the things I can;<br /> and wisdom to know the difference.<br /> (and as long as you are listening,<br /> a little hint on when the recovery<br /> will become self reinforcing would<br /> be appreciated.)
