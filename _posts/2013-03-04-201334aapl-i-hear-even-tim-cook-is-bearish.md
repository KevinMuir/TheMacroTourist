Wow.  It seems like it was only yesterday that everyone was falling all over themselves in their enthusiasm for Apple&#8217;s stock.  The company was going to rule the world and anyone who suggested otherwise just didn&#8217;t &#8216;get it&#8217;.  The unrelenting buying waves felt as never ending as the Maroon 5 song &#8216;Payphone&#8217; that my teenage daughter makes me listen to during car rides (google it if you have never heard it &#8211; it could be the worst song ever played on radio).  However, just as the fact that Payphone does eventually end, so did the raging bullishness towards Apple.

We have now gone from $705, at which point _everyone_ loved it, to $423 where _everyone _hates it.  The problems that were so invisible at the top have now become so unsurmountable at the bottom.

Benjamin Graham coined the phrase about the Mr. Market being manic and that your responsibility was to take advantage of his mood swings.  However, in this case, I like Warren Buffett&#8217;s take better:

> Then [Warren] turns to his usual speech about investing in stocks, giving a shout-out to Ben Graham’s idea of Mr. Market, which he says investors should think of as their partner. The beauty of having Mr. Market as a partner, he says, is that sometimes Mr. Market behaves like “a psychotic drunk.”

Did anything really change in Apple&#8217;s fundamental value from September of last year to today that would justify a 40% decline in its stock price?  Nope.

This is just a case where the &#8220;psychotic drunk&#8221; got into the liquor cabinet at the same time he found a well stocked medicine cabinet.  The combination was over exuberance to an extreme.  And now we are suffering from the massive hangover.

I was one massive Apple bear from $600 to $700.  I was admittedly way too early.  And so, as I now get bullish, remember that I am prone to being early.

However, I think that the investing public has become _way too bearish _on Apple.

Whereas before the common wisdom was that no one would ever catch up with Apple in terms of technology, it now seems like investors believe that Apple will never issue an innovative product ever again.

I am willing to take the other side of that trade.  This company is a massively well run well oiled machine whose stock simply became &#8216;over liked&#8217; to the point that there was simply too much expectations built into the price.  Whether it was the fact that it was the number one holding by hedge funds, or the fact that it was the most popular long position at TD Waterhouse, it was simply owned by too many who didn&#8217;t understand the risks that they were taking.

Now that we have spent the last six months shaking out those Apple fan boys, it is time to start seriously picking away at the long side.  I especially like the stock on a relative basis.  You might want to pick another name to short on the other side to hedge out the market risk.

However, this stock is now set up to surprise the other way.

I am not sure what that surprise will be.  Maybe they issue a massive stock buy back.  Maybe they introduce a flying car that affirms their role as technological leaders.  Either way, I think the next big surprise sends the stock higher, not lower.
