I am always amused when someone allows himself to be described as &#8220;The Legendary Mr. blah blah&#8221; on national TV.  Really?  &#8220;The Legendary?&#8221;   And I am doubly amused when a trader allows himself to be described this way as you know the Market Gods do not take kindly to this kind of hubris.
  
Although I am a little worried about angering the Gods by throwing some stones out the front door of my glass house, I am going to risk it.

Last week, &#8220;The Legendary&#8221; (as he is described on CNBC) Dennis Gartman suggested that a long position in the gold / copper spread should be initiated.  Now I don&#8217;t pay for the Gartman letter (is the letter &#8220;Legendary&#8221; as well?), but I used to, and I am familiar with Dennis&#8217; work.  I actually like him and I am really writing this with my tongue firmly planted in my cheek.  However, often when Dennis puts on positions, it makes the news and my Bloomberg alert fires me off a story with the details (I guess that is one of the benefits of being &#8220;Legendary&#8221;).

Usually I don&#8217;t find myself agreeing with Gartman&#8217;s positions, so I often just ignore it.  This trade made instant sense to me and I was actually a little upset that I hadn&#8217;t figured it out sooner.

With China making the transition from a infrastructure and capital spending economy to a more consumer based balanced one, the industrial commodity boom is going to take years to unwind its excesses.   There was simply way too much optimism, for way too much continued build out in China.

Copper, which is one of the most industrial of all commodities, will be in less and less demand in the coming years in China.

Gold on the other hand has very limited industrial uses and functions more as a store of value and an alternative currency.

If the Chinese are embarking on a seismic shift (as I believe they are), then gold will massively out perform copper.

When Dennis&#8217; letter came out, I started building my long gold / short copper position.

At first the position went our way (again, must have been his &#8220;Legendary&#8221; status helping it along) and in the next couple of days, Gartman suggested you add to the trade.

Then yesterday, copper got a big bid.

And then last night, China&#8217;s PMI was better than expected, and copper has continued to lift as gold has plummeted due to the backup in rates.

This has caused the Gold / Copper ratio to plunge.

This morning my Bloomberg spit out a wire that the &#8220;Legend&#8221; himself was covering the position.

Although I am no Legend, I am going to stand in here and do a little more.

I think the market is being way too optimistic about growth.  The trade makes sense and I think that in the coming months you will see this ratio scream to new highs.
