Most financial bloggers love to highlight all their wins. They love to show you how smart they are with all their prescient calls. Not me, I am too worried about the Market Gods striking me down if I even mention the occasional winner.

But I am happy to go over my terrible calls, and this next one is probably my biggest doozy.

Two years ago, if you would have told me that the Federal Reserve would be pumping $85 billion into the economy on a monthly basis through Quantitative Easing and would have asked me about the consequences of that action, I would have said that either it would be causing broad based traditional inflation, or it would be ineffective and the economy would be suffering from a deflationary spiral across the board. I know that seems to be two opposite answers, but to my reckoning, that sort of monetary expansion would either cause a the value of good and services in the things we need to rise, or the fact that we were pumping that much into the economy would mean that things were _really bad_ and therefore the economy was in the midst of a self reinforcing deflationary spiral.

**The one outcome that I would have never chosen, not even in a million years,** would be that the Federal Reserve would be able to inject that sort of insane amounts of stimulus and have it merely benignly levitate asset markets. I have been full stop wrong about the ability of the Federal Reserve to magically lift asset prices, and asset prices only.

Have a look at the following chart of the S&P 500 in yellow, versus the CRB commodity index:

You can see that a couple of years ago my theory was proving correct &#8211; the CRB was indeed rising faster than the S&P 500. However, during the last year, the CRB has gone down, while the S&P 500 has gone straight up.

I am not arguing that we need to have commodities rising just because the Federal Reserve is engaging in Quantitative Easing. I understand that the velocity of money has been falling faster than the expansion of supply, thereby reducing the overall rate of inflation. I just never expected the little inflation we did have to concentrate itself in equities and other financial assets.

I was a big believer (and part of me still is) that eventually the monetary expansion is going to go into things people need, as opposed to asset prices that the Fed wants to rise.

However, so far this call has been completely and utterly wrong.

The Federal Reserve has been able to restrict the inflation to financial asset prices, with seemingly no harm to the economy. I guess that I am just a foolish old skeptic for thinking that they wouldn&#8217;t be able to so neatly control where the money went. Good old Ben and the other ivory tower economic theoreticians have proven the old adage about there being no free lunch completely false. It turns out you can simply print into oblivion and have the money simply propel financial asset prices higher.

No wonder there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any end in sight to the monetary stimulus that is being applied. Why should there be? It is all peaches and cream. There is no adverse effects (at least not immediately that most people can recognize) and so there is absolutely no incentive to stop.

I had thought that the money expansion would flow into commodities such as energy and food, halting the ability of the Federal Reserve to simply expand willy nilly. I obviously thought wrong. I guess I should have just closed my eyes and bought the Four Horsemen! (Tesla, Netflix, LinkedIn and Facebook)
