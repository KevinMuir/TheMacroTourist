> You want winners? You want me to put my Cramer Berkowitz hedge fund hat on and just discuss what my fund is buying today to try to make money tomorrow and the next day and the next? You want my top 10 stocks for who is going to make it in the New World? You know what? I am going to give them to you. Right here. Right now.
> 
> OK. Here goes. Write them down &#8212; no handouts here!: 724 Solutions, Ariba, Digital Island, Exodus, InfoSpace.com, Inktomi, Mercury Interactive, Sonera, VeriSign and Veritas Software.

> We are buying some of every one of these this morning as I give this speech. We buy them every day, particularly if they are down, which, no surprise given what they do, is very rare. And we will keep doing so until this period is over &#8212; and it is very far from ending. Heck, people are just learning these stories on Wall Street, and the more they come to learn, the more they love and own! Most of these companies don&#8217;t even have earnings per share, so we won&#8217;t have to be constrained by that methodology for quarters to come.

> There, now that that&#8217;s done with, can we talk about the methodology that produced those top 10 so that you can understand how, in a universe of a gazillion stocks, we arrived at those, so you too can figure it out? I hope we can because I have another 10 and still another 10 and another. They all do the same thing: They make the Web faster, cheaper, better and easier to access anywhere, anytime. They allow you to get on the Web securely anywhere in the world. They make the Web economy the only economy that matters. That&#8217;s all they do.

I probably don&#8217;t have to tell you how Cramer&#8217;s list of the &#8220;Winners of the New World&#8221; did after his big speech at the height of the DotCom bubble. For today&#8217;s market bulls, it is easy to dismiss this outlandish claim as being from a different time that is not applicable to today. However, in early 2000 these claims did not seem that outlandish. 

Just like today the idea that Tesla, Facebook, Netflix and LinkedIn might be a bubble seems like the foolish grumblings of an old cranky man. I have singled out those four stocks as my &#8220;Four Horsemen&#8221; of the speculative rally, but Cramer has done us one better and has helped us out by listing some other stocks that are going to hold up quite well despite their massively overbought nature. From ZeroHedge: 

> Cramer warned that despite many names&#8217; approaching overbought territory, a handful of &#8220;cult&#8221; stocks should continue their rally through the rest of the year, supported by a group of dedicated buyers with high expectations. One such company is Tesla Motors, he said. &#8220;That thing is such a cult, I don&#8217;t want to get in front of a cult.&#8221; He also listed Netflix, Ulta Salon, Lumber Liquidators, Yelp and Tractor Supply as having similar support.

So with Cramer&#8217;s help, we have created another index, our &#8220;Cramer Cult&#8221; index that we have set a baseline of 100 at the start of 2013. Here it is for your amusement:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/10/CULTOct0313.gif" alt="CULTOct0313" title="CULTOct0313.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

It is not quite as rock solid as my &#8220;Four Horsement&#8221; index, but it is pretty impressive nonetheless. From 100 to 277 in 9 months is none too shabby. 

Good thing Cramer says they will continue to rally.
