I have been lucky enough to have caught this bull market move in the stock market.  Although I am tempted to start peeling off some of my exposure into the strength, I still feel that this rally is quite &#8216;hated&#8217; by market professionals.

Today we had a breakout in the Canadian stock index:

The US market has also been chugging upwards and we are sitting at new highs on that index as well:

I would by no means advocate adding to large longs as we are quite extended.  However, I think the play right now is to simply let &#8217;em run.  I am usually always surprised at how far these types of moves can go.  The mistake would be to get neutral too soon.
