A week or so ago I recommended shorting European stocks ([link)](http://gfbtrading.com/the-macro-tourist/2013/1/25/yh6pzj3wdlcfimhy9x2e1xn6tj4axh).  Since then the trade has worked out nicely:

You will also notice that this is not a case of the entire global stock market dragging European stocks downward.  The European stocks have been decidedly weaker than the rest of the global stock markets:

The chart above is the ratio of the EuroStoxx 50 vs the S&P 500.  The last week has shown massive European relative weakness.

My whole premise for putting on this trade was that the European markets would underperform due to the fact that the ECB is the tightest major Central Bank.

Tomorrow we have an ECB meeting and there is increasing pressure for them to join the global liquidity-fest.

Given that the trade has worked so well and that the European stock indexes are bumping into some pretty major support areas, it is time to lighten up.

I am not predicting that the ECB will succumb to these pressure, but as Robert Duvall told Tom Cruise in Days of Thunder:

> Cole you are wandering all over the track!

> Yeah well this son of a bitch just slammed into me.

> No, no, he didn&#8217;t slam you, he didn&#8217;t bump you, he didn&#8217;t nudge you&#8230; he rubbed you.  **_And rubbin&#8217;, son, is racing._**

Well, covering some of my position into this dip is trading.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I am sure that Robert Duvall would approve.
