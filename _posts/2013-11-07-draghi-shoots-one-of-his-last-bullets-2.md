This morning in a stunning move, the ECB&#8217;s Mario Draghi shot one of his last remaining bullets before being completely constrained by the zero bound for interest rates:

> At todayâ€™s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions:
> 
> The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be decreased by 25 basis points to 0.25%, starting from the operation to be settled on 13 November 2013.
> 
> The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be decreased by 25 basis points to 0.75%, with effect from 13 November 2013.
> 
> The interest rate on the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%.

Whether purposely or not, the ECB completely surprised the market with only 3 of the 70 economists that Bloomberg polls expecting the rate cut. 

The markets have reacted by taking the Euro out to the woodshed and at the same time ramping European stocks into new highs.

Before I delve into my analysis and game plan, I just want to point out that someone knew the information before the public announcement. While we were waiting for the official release, all of a sudden the US bond market went big time bid for no real reason. I have made a chart of the Euro currency (in white) and the yield on the US 5 year yield (yellow):

It is a little hard to see, but you will notice that the bond yield plunged almost half of its move before the actual announcement (which is clear from the vertical line downward in the Euro). Someone knew the results early. 

Maybe this guy still has connections and gets an early call?

As for me, I obviously don&#8217;t get an early heads up as my rolodex is not filled with the names of shady Central Bankers. This is painfully obvious as my European positions are pretty well the exact opposite of what you want given this surprise.

Let&#8217;s first examine why Draghi chose to surprise the market. Most financial watchers are worried (to varying degrees) about the froth in the stock and credit markets, yet, first the Federal Reserve and now the ECB, both chose to ignore those concerns and either delay tapering in the case of the Fed, or actually cutting rates in the case of the ECB. The reason for this disconnect between the financial community and the Central Bankers is that although the bubble like conditions are quite obvious for everyone to see, there is **_absolutely no incentive for the Central Banks to proactively prick a financial bubble, especially given the fact that inflation is trending lower._**

At the end of the day, both of these Central Banks have inflation as their most important goal for setting policy. The ECB is staring right into the eyes of a tsunami of de-leveraging which is causing inflation to trend lower:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/EURCPINov0713.gif" alt="EURCPINov0713" title="EURCPINov0713.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

Don&#8217;t forget that the ECB&#8217;s target inflation rate is 2%. The latest 0.7% reading, with no sign of any uptick on the horizon, means that the ECB is dramatically undershooting their target. Therefore regardless of whether German housing prices are heading to the moon, or whether there is a euphoric like bid in European equities is all irrelevant for the ECB. Their goal is to hit their inflation target and with inflation running so far below 2%, they view a further easing of monetary policy as the correct course of action.

You could make an argument that this policy is extremely backward looking and does not use common sense, but it is what it is. To expect a committee to make a bold view and run a relative tighter monetary policy than would otherwise be required because of frothy financial markets is asking too much. 

I had thought that the Germans were still exerting enough influence that Draghi would put this easing off into the future, but obviously I misread their ability to sway the committee.

Which brings me to the question about what to do with all my positions that are bleeding red this morning?

From a short term perspective I am obviously really wrong. And by no means am I going to add to a losing trade. However, I am questioning about whether I should give up on my trade right now into the emotional move.

My whole thesis was that the ECB&#8217;s balance sheet was not expanding as fast as other Central Bank&#8217;s which would cause a relatively tighter monetary policy. Although at the margin this decrease of 25 basis points for the overnight borrowing will cause an incremental enticement for banks to lend, I think it is foolish to assume that this move is going to cause a rush of borrowing.

The European economy is suffering from a liquidity trap and as we have seen time and time again, simply lowering the interest rate has _very limited effect in this type of situation._ The problem is with a lack of demand for borrowing, not the price of the borrowing. To think that the economy will respond to the lowering of the cost of borrowing is to ignore everything we have learned since the end of the credit super cycle in 2008.

For now, I am going to hold off covering any of my positions and give it a few days to cook before I take any action. I am not outright short stocks, but long US stocks against my European short, so that makes it a little less painful as the US stocks are at least moving up on the news. 

Also don&#8217;t forget that the &#8216;no-taper&#8217; announcement day of the Federal Reserve marked the exact interim high in the stock market. There is a decent chance that we see a similar reaction in European stocks.

Rightly or wrongly, I am hunkering down and not doing anything into this announcement. I think it is probably more cosmetic than real and although I am loath to argue with the market, I think this move is ignoring the present day economic conditions of Europe.
