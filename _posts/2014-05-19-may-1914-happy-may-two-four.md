Today is a holiday in Canada. Victoria Day is the official name of the holiday, but Canadians affectionally know it is as the May two-four long week-end.

Contrary to popular belief, it is not always cold in Canada, and so I am relieved to report that my fridge is still working.

I was planning on working this Monday and taking off the Memorial Day holiday, but since my fridge is full of beer &#8211; I decided to stay up at the lake with the family for an extra day.

Updates will return tomorrow. Happy May two-four!
