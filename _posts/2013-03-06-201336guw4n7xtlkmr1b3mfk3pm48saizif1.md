Over the last couple of weeks I have quietly being nibbling on getting long gold.  So far I have put on the long position against the S&P500.  It worked right off the hop, and I looked like I might actually know something, but then the Market Gods decided that it should never be that easy and sent the ratio right back to new lows.

I am sticking to my plan of using 1.00 as a stop and so far I have been not stopped out.

I was planning on writing up this piece about all the pain in the resource equity sector, with gold stocks at the forefront of the agony, when I noticed this &#8216;great&#8217; article in Business Insider &#8211; **[&#8220;If you thought Ron Paul&#8217;s Investments in Big Gold Miners were doing badly, check out his investments in &#8216;juniors'&#8221;](http://www.businessinsider.com/ron-paul-junior-miners-2013-3).  **The article goes on to list how badly Ron Paul&#8217;s gold stocks are doing (needless to say, it is not good).  The writer has a smugness to his writing that makes me think we are getting to the point where I should increase my gold long positions.  When the press starts to pick on people&#8217;s poor investments you know the odds favour putting in a bottom.  It is a sign that they are bold enough to write the article that sentiment is so skewed in the other direction that a turn is bound to be right around the corner.

I am increasing my gold and gold stock positions.  I know absolutely nothing about picking individual gold stock names so I am going to just buy the GDX ETF.

This is knife catching at its absolutely best (or worst depending on your attitude towards this dangerous practice).

Remember that the hardest trade is often the best trade.  Fading the cocky Business Insider article is tough, it feels like gold and gold miners have not had a decent up move in ages.  However, the fact that it is so tough to buy them is the very reason it might work (and also the fact that the Market Gods usually punish anyone who takes joy in another&#8217;s loss)&#8230;
