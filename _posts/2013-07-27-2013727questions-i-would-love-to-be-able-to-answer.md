I am still somewhat cautious about the markets.  Since coming back from my month long vacation, I am finding it difficult to sync back up with the recent action.

As I scan through the charts, I am faced with more questions than answers.

## Why did Japanese stocks sell off 3% on Friday and is this simply a correction, or the start of something more ominous?

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/51f3d854e4b04b5d7e615505/1374935124896/NKY%20Jul%2027%2013-1.jpg" />

Could it be that Japan&#8217;s expansionary monetary policy is fully baked in?  What will happen if the Yen starts to rally and their stock market goes down?  Will they be able to print even more?

## Just how big is the credit problem in China?

Most observers are downplaying the credit problem in China.  They are all quick to make excuses and explain why &#8216;China is different&#8217;.  Sounds a lot like the excuses that were made at the start of the US housing bubble popping.

This is a chart of the over night rate that Chinese banks lend to one another.  It spiked up to above 12% last month.  There was obviously some serious stresses in the Chinese financial system, but are they now all fixed?

While we are on the topic of China&#8230;

## Do you really think this time is different and the mining industry did not wildly over estimate the &#8216;perpetual Chinese&#8217; demand for their product?

During the early to mid 2000s, the TSX Venture exchange was the hottest stock market around.  Absolute fortunes were made as investors could not get enough of the companies that were going to supply China&#8217;s perpetual demand for commodities.

When the 2008 credit crisis hit, these companies were crushed as world trade ground to a halt.  However, the fact that China responded with some aggressive stimulus meant that very quickly the rebuilding continued.  The perma-bulls were proven right and it looked like we had entered into a new era.

But there are no new eras and over the last couple of years, the investing public has begun to realize that the idea that China would grow at 10% forever and buy every ounce of metal that we mined was probably not correct.

Is it realistic to expect these companies to ever be viable?  Was that whole 2000s commodity bubble wasted money just like the 1990s dot com bubble?

## Have the problems dealing with this mess in Australia and Canada just begun, or have they mostly being priced in?

There is no doubt that the investing community has recently realized the gross misallocation of capital that has happened in Australia and Canada (and other commodity type countries).  And they have reacted accordingly, sending those currencies lower:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/AUD%20Jul%2027%2013.gif" /><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/CAD%20July%2027%2013.gif" />

Is this the tip of the iceberg, or has the move run its course?

## Will money velocity ever rise again?

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/51f3e0c7e4b0de43ba5fd5d1/1374937288168/M2V_Max_630_378%20Jul%2027%2013.png" />

Money velocity &#8211; straight down, without relent.  If you can answer the question of when this will bottom, then all your investing problems would be over.  But does anyone really know?

## Will the public continue selling bonds, or will they keep the faith?

I have long been worried about the public&#8217;s recent infatuation with all things fixed income.  I believe that the recent bond market sell off was a long time coming and that the public had been piling into bond funds at the worst possible time.

Last month there was a massive stampede for the exits, but is the rush over?  Or were those just the first patrons to leave the theatre?
