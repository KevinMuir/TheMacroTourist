If somehow one of the Market Gods suddenly appeared before me, and like a genie, granted the answer to just one economic question, there would be no doubt in my mind what I would ask. **The future rate of the velocity of money is all that I would be interested in knowing.**

The velocity of money holds the key to understanding how the economy and markets are going to perform in the coming years.

For many decades following WWII the velocity of money was quite stable. This led economists to believe that the monetary base was the most important variable in determining the level of economic activity. An increase or decrease in the base had a predictable effect on the economy. Then during the 1990s the velocity actually increased, but due to the effect of a globalization and the fall of the Berlin Wall, traditional inflation stayed low and the expansion of the money supply manifested itself in the form of financial asset inflation. This all came to a crashing halt with the collapse of the credit super cycle in 2008. Since then, the velocity of money has only gone one way &#8211; straight down.

I have been arguing that as long as the world&#8217;s Central Banks stay on their current course of ever increasing excessively easy monetary policy eventually the velocity of money will turn up. So far though, I have been completely wrong.

The velocity of money has simply continued to plummet:

This slumping velocity has caused inflation to stay very low:

Even though the Federal Reserve has engaged in an absolute massive expansion of the monetary base:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/FARBASTNov1313.gif" alt="FARBASTNov1313" title="FARBASTNov1313.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

Without at least a stabilization of the velocity of money, the unnervingly large Quantitative Easing is simply collecting as excess bank reserves without being lent out:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/ExcessReservesNov1313.png" alt="ExcessReservesNov1313" title="ExcessReservesNov1313.png" border="0" width="600" height="360" />

My main thesis has been that with the massive amount of fuel that the worlds&#8217; Central Banks have being adding to the monetary base, the risks of an eventual ignition causing a tremendous swoosh upwards in all prices that cannot be controlled is the correct bet. 

However, lately I have been noticing an increasing amount of economists and strategists that are giving up on this forecast. More and more are becoming convinced that QE is not inflationary and that the velocity of money will continue to trend lower. There are a variety of different reasons for their belief, but I am not interested in debating this point right now and will leave that for another post.

**What I am interested in exploring is whether the recent increase in the stock market is a result of the market anticipating an increase in the velocity of money (and an upturn in the economy) or whether the public is simply chasing the latest asset class in our difficult zero interest rate environment.**

Ever since the Federal Reserve slashed rates to zero and proceeded to inject massive amounts of liquidity into the banking system, investors have been struggling to find suitable investments for this new era.

At first, they rushed to gold and other hard assets as QE seemed destined to produce massive inflation. This can best be illustrated from the more than doubling of the total units of the GLD ETF outstanding in the period between 2008 and 2010:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/GLDOutNov1313.gif" alt="GLDOutNov1313" title="GLDOutNov1313.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

When combined with the price appreciation in the actual metal, this caused the GLD ETF to take the title of the world&#8217;s largest ETF &#8211; eclipsing the massive S&P500 ETF.

But this mad scramble into gold took a turn for the worst in the late half of 2011, and investors have been steadily abandoning this investment thesis as gold has given up a good portion of its gains.

Investors have also turned their eyes towards fixed income. If the Fed was going to buy so many bonds, then investors mistakenly reasoned that fixed income would be a good place to hide. 

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/BondFlowsNov1313.jpg" alt="BondFlowsNov1313" title="BondFlowsNov1313.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="387" />

You will notice that after the credit bursting in 2008 and before this spring, there were only two months that money did scramble into US bond funds. The public rushed into the very asset that the Fed was driving up, and in doing so, caused US 10 year bond yields to hit the absurd level of sub 1.5%. 

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/usg10yNov1313.gif" alt="Usg10yNov1313" title="usg10yNov1313.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

During this period, they stuffed money into many different types of fixed income investments, all the while, selling their equity allocations.

However, just like gold, this mad scramble ended in tears when the bond market quickly gave up a good portion of its gains with a massive retracement this summer. Investors realized that maybe buying fixed income at multi-generational negative real rates was not such a good idea.

The recent history of investors trying to find suitable investments in the zero rate environment has been far from reassuring. Investors have driven up both gold and bonds, piling into both at the exact wrong time, only to get completely burned when the investment turned out not to be based on any fundamental value, but instead simply a case of trying to find someplace to park their savings.

As for today, investors have now decided that the place to be is equities.

Even though the stocks are now already up over 150% from the lows, the public had decided that the all clear for equities has been sounded:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/EquityFLowsNov1313.jpg" alt="EquityFLowsNov1313" title="EquityFLowsNov1313.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="408" />

**Which brings me back to my question that I would like answered by the Market Gods &#8211; is the market up because the velocity of money has finally turned or is this simply a case of the public once again chasing a new asset class after being burned by everything else?**

Unfortunately simply looking at the investment flows does not really answer the question. Yes the public is indeed piling into equities after an already extended move, but that fact does not _necessarily mean they will be wrong._ Maybe the monetary fuel is finally on the verge of being lit. Maybe the economy is about to explode higher. Maybe bonds are headed lower because there is finally a demand for credit which is a necessary condition to have the velocity of money increase. Maybe the public moved out of bonds and into equities because this shift has finally started to occur.

However, so far there is very little evidence to support this theory.

The S&P&#8217;s actual earnings have basically been flatlining over the last two years, with most of the current stock market rise the result of P/E expansion as opposed to actual improvement in the operating results.

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/EarningNov1313.svg-1.jpg" alt="EarningNov1313 svg 1" title="EarningNov1313.svg-1.jpg" border="0" width="599" height="353" />

After rebounding sharply from the 2009 dip, the GDP growth has once again turned lower and is slipping to just over 3% in nominal dollars:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/GDPYoyNov1313.gif" alt="GDPYoyNov1313" title="GDPYoyNov1313.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

This hardly looks like the chart of an economy that is about to bust higher.

Now maybe I am wrong, maybe the stock market knows more than I do. Or maybe it doesn&#8217;t matter that the economy and earnings are disappointing, the fact of the matter is that in a zero rate environment the capital has to go somewhere, and that stocks will stay at a permanently elevated level.

But it certainly looks to me that this is simply a case of a twice burned public chasing the next fad. Just like they got burned by gold, and then by bonds, I don&#8217;t think this is going to turn out any better.

Remember that in the long run, valuation matters! Have a look at this great chart that shows expected future returns based on valuations:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/iVuiK8S2.4RU-1.png" alt="IVuiK8S2 4RU 1" title="iVuiK8S2.4RU-1.png" border="0" width="600" height="420" />

The worlds&#8217; Central Banks zero interest rate policies have created a very perverse environment. Investors are forced to chase different asset class in an attempt to preserve their wealth. With real rates being so deeply negative, it is quite difficult. 

Unfortunately, the public seems to think that the best predictor of future return is past returns. This has caused 1 to 2 year asset chases that seem to develop a certain amount of momentum but that have continually ended badly. I unfortunately think that the stock market is not predicting a future upturn the economy, but has simply become the latest asset class du jour.

I just wish the Market Gods would confirm that for me&#8230;
