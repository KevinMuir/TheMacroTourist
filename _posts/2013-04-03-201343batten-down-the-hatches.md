Today is pretty ugly and although I have been fairly cautious on the market, I have still somehow managed to find ways to have losing trades that overwhelm my short hedges.

I am not sure what is going to happen, but I do know this is no time to be a hero.  Don&#8217;t forget that the whole financial system is held together by the notion that the Fed and other Central Banks will print indefinitely and justify these inflated values.

There is very little fundamental value in any asset price as everything has been stretched by investors heading out the risk curve.  This is the kind of environment where psychology could switch very quickly and things get much uglier in a hurry.
