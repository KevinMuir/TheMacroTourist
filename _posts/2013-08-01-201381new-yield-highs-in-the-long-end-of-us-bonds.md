This morning we had some more good economic news out of the US.  The Initial Jobless Claims fell an unexpected 20k and the Continuing Claims fell by 50k.   Also, the ISM Manufacturing Survey came in at a surprising robust 55.4 versus an expected 52.0.

Although the bond market rallied after the initial sell off yesterday, this morning the good news has proven way too much for it too handle, and we are closing at new highs in yield for this move.

The bond market is acting terribly.  We have a whole generation of yield reaching boomers who have stuffed their accounts with supposedly &#8216;safe&#8217; bond funds at all time lows in yields, that are suddenly waking up to the fact that their investment is now quickly offside in a big way.

I am not sure where we go from here.  Part of me says that this pain is reaching a crescendo and that with bonds now offering decent positive real yields, it might be time to take some off the panicky sellers&#8217; hands.  However, another part of me remembers that I am always way too early, and that I should probably put that thought away to revisit it in a month.

Either way, it is ugly in bond land and we are reaching a point where we either get a bounce, or an wicked acceleration to the downside.  Watch for a pickup in volatility.
