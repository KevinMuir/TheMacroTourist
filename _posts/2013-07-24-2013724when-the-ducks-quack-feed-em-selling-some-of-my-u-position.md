On trading desks there is a great saying &#8211; &#8220;when the ducks quack &#8211; feed &#8217;em.&#8221;

The ducks are quacking pretty hard on one of my long positions, so I am taking this opportunity to feed &#8217;em some of my position.

Sometime back, I bought U CN Equity which is a closed end fund that owns uranium.  Long term I am extremely positive on uranium and given that this fund was trading at a discount, it seemed like a great way to play it.

It seems that I am not alone in my belief in this story and recently the hedge funds have become increasingly involved.  I even noticed that one of the funds that I respect the most &#8211; WestFace Capital &#8211; filed that they now own over 10% of U CN Equity.

These funds are large, and when they buy, it moves the market.  The nice little discount that I was buying U CN Equity at has quickly transformed into a premium.

As much as I respect WestFace, I am going to take this opportunity to &#8220;feed the ducks&#8221; and sell a lot of my position.

I believe I can be nimble enough to buy this back lower, or find some other uranium play.  The built in edge of buying at a discount has disappeared and it is time to ring the register.
