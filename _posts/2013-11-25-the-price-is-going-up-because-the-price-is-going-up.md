I have always been a huge Soros fan. There can be no denying that he is one of the greatest investors that has ever lived. Over the years I have also read about his right hand man, Stanley Druckenmiller, but apart from an interview in Market Wizards and the very occasional other article, he stayed well hidden behind the scenes.

However, during the last couple of years, Stan has been doing a few more interviews and telling some stories about his days with Soros. As I have learned more about him, I realize that great people put themselves in the company of other great people, and that Stan has the same sort of amazing skill that Soros possesses. It really should be no surprise as Soros actually handed over the day to day managing of the fund to Druckenmiller so that he could concentrate on his philanthropy. Anyone who has the confidence of Soros to run his money is obviously a great talent.

Recently Druckenmiller was interviewed on Bloomberg TV, and in this interview, he told the story about his famous &#8220;buying the top&#8221; of the 2000 dot com bubble.

> &#8220;&#8230; so in 1999 as was widely reported, I bought the top of the tech market in March of 2000 in an emotional fit that I had because I couldn&#8217;t stand the fact that it was going up so much and I violated every rule that I had learned in 25 years. I quit Soros.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Hold on, let&#8217;s go back a sec. You think the mistake you made in buying all that tech was emotion?&#8221; asked the Bloomberg interviewer.
> 
> &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it was, I know it was. I bought the tech market very well in January 99 and had sold it out and was sitting pretty, but I had two internal managers who were making 5% a day and I couldn&#8217;t stand it. I put billions of dollars in within hours of the top. And boy did I get killed in the next couple of months.&#8221;

When you listen to this veteran hedge fund manager speak with complete and brutal honesty about the difficulty in not participating in a monster bull market, you begin to understand the massive pull that accompanies manias.

The desire to be part of the herd creates a situation where once the markets reach a certain momentum, the price starts to go up because it is going up. 

Soros understood this better than anyone. He likes to say that when he sees a bubble, he buys it.

In fact, Soros was the first to apply the term reflexivity to the markets and wrote an entire book on how price action causes a self reinforcing cycle that in fact does not exhibit traditional supply demand behaviour. Usually when the price of something rise, the demand decreases. If the demand for iPads at a $600 price point is 10 million units, then at $800 the demand might be only 9.5 million units. 

**Financial markets are unusual in that sometimes the price rising will actually cause demand to increase.** 

The difficulty is in determining when the price action is strong enough to feed on itself. Does the recent rise convince enough new buyers to enter the market? Or does the new higher price simply give the sellers a chance to sell at inflated prices? It is never easy, and in fact, often the point where the market seems the most stretched and prone to rolling over is the point where reflexivity kicks in.

Which brings me to today.

I have been trying to take stabs on the short side for the last couple of weeks. Although I had been bullish and long earlier in the year, as usual I gave up too early, and even worse, tried to fade the strength just as the reflexivity was kicking in.

I am not alone in being concerned that prices are being completely disconnected from the fundamentals, there are a lot of guys way smarter than me, like Jeremy Grantham and John Hussman, who are voicing concerns about the market.

However, even though these guys will most likely be proven correct, my job is to manage risk. Being in the company of smart guys doesn&#8217;t do you any good if you are wrong.

Since the advent of the QE programs, I have often written to myself as a reminder that I need to be aware that some day, the gargantuan monetary stimulus was going to kick in and that being short was going to be scary. I had thought that it would show up as economic strength first, but the market is not giving me that luxury. The QE money is indeed kicking in and causing a rally in stocks that is even more difficult to embrace because it is moving in the exact opposite direction of the economic fundamentals.

Here is a chart of the last few months; the S&P is the yellow line, which has been headed straight up with the CitiBank Economic Surprise Index in white heading straight down showing that the economy is continually surprising to the downside:

There is an adage on Wall Street that the market will do what confounds the most people, and I guess that is what is happening.

The Fed pushing down interest rates to zero and then printing mountains of money has forced investors out the risk curve. This process seems to have developed a reflexive self reinforcing cycle whose ultimate top looks increasingly foolish to attempt to pinpoint.

I am going to give up on my stabs on the short side for a little bit. The bears should rejoice because this very well might indicate that the correction is going to descend upon us shortly. However please note that I am by no means getting long, so I guess I will have to become a full &#8220;convert&#8221; before the top will be made.

I notice that I am not alone in grappling with this relentless strength. Yesterday the famous Scottish hedge fund manager Hugh Hendy threw in the towel on the short side;

> The manager acknowledged his changing stance may be viewed by some investors as a &#8216;top of the market&#8217; signal, but said he is not concerned by the prospect of a crash.
> 
> &#8220;I may be providing a public utility here, as the last bear to capitulate. You are well within your rights to say â€˜sell&#8217;. The S&P 500 is up 30% over the past year: I wish I had thought this last year.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Crashing is the least of my concerns. I can deal with that, but I cannot risk my reputation because we are in this virtuous loop where the market is trending.&#8221; 

This certainly seems to have the same sort of &#8220;just get me in&#8221; tone that Stanley Druckenmiller spoke about in 1999.

And maybe we will look back at this point and say, &#8220;yes that indeed was the top.&#8221;

However, I am not so sure. 

I am actually a little mad at myself for getting sucked into trying to short the overbought stock market. Although I should know better for the simple fact that new highs are usually not great shorting opportunities, there is another reason that I should have avoided writing any pink tickets. **I have been trying to remind myself that bull markets always end with the Central Bank tightening monetary policy.** The old maxim &#8220;three steps and a stumble&#8221; refers to the fact that bull markets have traditionally ended on the third Central Bank tightening increase.

To be fair, the fact that we have reached this perverted world of QE and ZIRP has made this traditional signal much more difficult to place the usual degree of confidence. I have been concerned that we might indeed roll over without the Fed tightening. The zero hour of monetary policy simply refusing to work weighed at the back of my mind. I had mistakenly believed that this time might be different (it never is) and that maybe we didn&#8217;t need the Fed to tighten to actually roll over. 

But it doesn&#8217;t look like this is the case. It seems that even when faced with a decaying fundamental backdrop, stocks still manage to rally from the QE injection. 

Which brings me to my main theory that I have long held as the ultimate end game. I can&#8217;t remember if I came up with this before Bill Fleckenstein, but he certainly does a much better job at articulating it. The theory is that the Fed and the other Central Banks will continue to aggressively expand until the bond market takes away the printing press.

Over the last few decades, during each economic cycle, the Central Bankers have needed to apply more and more monetary stimulus to encourage the borrowing needed to create economic growth.

Unfortunately it has taken more and more debt to create the same dollar of growth:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/83155efc859c003430e3baa0e8806f32.jpeg" alt="83155efc859c003430e3baa0e8806f32" title="83155efc859c003430e3baa0e8806f32.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="466" />

The level of indebtedness continues to grow with no cleansing of the debts as the Central Banks desperately try to stop this painful de-leveraging stage of the business cycle from occurring. 

So each and every cycle, the solution is to offer more and more cheap money, encourage more and more debt, with every cycle needing more and more intervention to achieve less and less.

Some day, the bond market is going to revolt against this cheap money solution.

At that point, the market will force the debt restructuring that the Central Banks continually try to put off with their ever increasing monetary injections. 

Inflation might be the catalyst for this crisis or it might be the result. If inflation raises its ugly head first, then the bond market will respond with a vicious sell off. If for some reason the bond market sells off before inflation comes, then given the massively indebted nature of our economies, the Central Banks will have no choice but to attempt to print more to stabilize the bond market. This will only cause the bond market to go down more as ultimately printing is inflationary.

And before you tell me that the bond market cannot go down without inflation, remember what happened this year:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/CPIvsYIELDSNOV2613.gif" alt="CPIvsYIELDSNOV2613" title="CPIvsYIELDSNOV2613.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

Even though inflation had been heading steadily lower and is well below the Fed&#8217;s target rate, 10 year bond yields rose from 1.50% to almost 2.0%. 

We all know the result of this 50 basis points back up in 10 year yield &#8211; the Fed delayed their QE tapering plans specifically because of this backup in rates (from the Fed&#8217;s September statement):

> The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall, but the tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months, if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market.

Given the massive over indebted nature of the Western economies, no Central Bank can allow their real rates to rise. 

Therefore any backup in rates is going to met with more printing, which will only prove more inflationary. 

Eventually the bond market is going to figure out the end game. The short end of the curve will be pinned to zero, but the long end, which the Central Banks don&#8217;t control, will be aggressively sold. **Before this over, I expect record wides in the yield curve.** It would not surprise me at all to see the short end at zero (or some other nominally low level) and the long end at almost double digits. 

Market participants always hedge to protect themselves from the last crisis. Most investors believe that buying puts on stocks is the way to protect their portfolios. I believe that it is never that easy, and that surprises are by their very definition, something no one expects.

I believe that the next crisis will be the result of the bond market falling out of bed, and that on a relative basis, stocks will perform much better. 

Which is why I am a little mad at myself for trying to pick a top in the stock market. 

Yes, I think stocks are priced on the basis of a lot of optimistic assumptions, but I guess relative to bonds, they are still much better.

I am lucky in that I don&#8217;t need to be invested, and I am happy to trade opportunistically. I am going to focus on my bond short as I believe that from a risk reward basis, that is the higher probability trade. 

Stocks are expensive, and massively over bought. From a fundamental point of view, I am hard pressed to see why anyone would get excited about owning this asset class at this stage. Yet, I recognize that they have hit the point where they are going up because they are going up. And given the massive amounts of money that have been injected by the worlds&#8217; Central Bankers, trying to time the slight pull backs is probably a fool&#8217;s errand. 

Instead of wasting mental energy fighting this wall of money, I am going to focus on the big picture trade that I think will ultimately prove a much bigger problem than anyone imagines. 

The super aggressive monetary policies will continue until the bond market takes away the press, so instead of fading the stock market, I am going to focus on the other portion of the end game. This makes more sense because even if I manage to time a slight pull back in the stock market, given the worlds&#8217; Central Banks commitment to monetary masochism, I will only be faced with an even bigger mountain of money being thrown at the problem. 

I refuse to buy stocks because they are &#8220;the only game in town&#8221;, but I will instead focus my energy on what I believe will be the market&#8217;s eventual undoing &#8211; the bond market taking away the printing press.
