<span style="line-height: 1.6em">Funny how it always happens the same way.  The market gets on a roll, the commentators and strategists get progressively more confident, the market keeps going up thus making the bulls even more bold.  At the crescendo of the &#8216;feel good&#8217; orgy, there doesn&#8217;t seem like there will ever be a piece of news that can derail the move higher. </span>

It is the hardest thing to do, but at that very moment, when it seems like there is no way that this many people could be wrong &#8211; that is the point where you need to sell it.

I have been fortunate enough to have being able to withstand the siren song of the bulls and now actually have a large short position with a positive P&L attached to it.

Although I am now well onside, at this point, I am at a little more of a loss what to do.

We have gone down a long way:

Even the much adored European stock market has finally sagged:

Now some will say I got lucky with my short and that without the problems in Syria, I would still be offside.  I disagree.  If the market was not so egregiously overbought the bulls would have been able to shake off the Syrian news.

No, the market was due to roll over &#8211; it simply was looking for an excuse.

But what really worries me more than the Syrian situation is the continued collapse of the Asian markets.

Have a look at the Indian Rupee and the Indonesian Rupiah:

These markets are in free fall.  This is a very real problem for these economies.  I don&#8217;t really know enough about either market to comment if the problem is due to get worse or almost finished collapsing, but I do know that these sorts of macro type events are often ignored by Western markets, but that eventually the reality can be ignored no longer and the selling expands to our side of the world.

If it weren&#8217;t for the continued collapse of these markets, I might be tempted to lift more of my short position.

As it stands, I am going to ring the register on a tiny portion of the short, but will leave the vast majority on for now.<span style="line-height: 1.6em"> </span>
