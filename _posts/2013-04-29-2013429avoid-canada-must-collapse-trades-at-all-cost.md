Two years ago the Disciples from the &#8216;Church of China Must Grow at 10% Forever&#8217; had convinced most investors that Canadian resource markets were an absolutely terrific place to park the bulk of one&#8217;s net worth.  Now that this trade has completely collapsed, they are piling on the short side with a &#8216;Canada must collapse trade&#8217; with equal fervour.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am a big China bear and I do believe that this will eventually result in the resource countries like Canada and Australia getting hit hard. However, the amount of pessimism that I am reading in regards to Canadian asset markets is truly astounding.

Any time there are this many newly minted bears telling me why something must collapse, I have to take pause and wonder if their timing might be a little off.  Tell me, when was the last collapse that the majority of investors predicted?

This week-end in the Globe & Mail there was a story of Vijai Mohan, the hedge fund manager who has &#8216;staked 95 percent of his investor&#8217;s assets on a wager that the country&#8217;s [Canada&#8217;s] housing market and banking sector are about to come apart at the seams.&#8217;  He has also bet heavily on the Loonie collapsing.

And he is not alone.  According to the CFTC, in the last six months the speculative futures positions for the Canadian dollar have gone from a record high to a record low:

My inbox is filled with article after article outlining why the Canadian economy is doomed.

This piece appeared in the Financial Post highlighting the recent increase in shorting Canadian bank stocks:

> The short interest ratio for Canadian banks, which looks at how long it would take short sellers to cover their positions if a stock begins to rise, has moved up to 10.1 trading days. Anything over five days is generally considered bearish. Compare that with major U.S. banks, where the ratio is only 1.3 trading days.

> “The increase in short interest for Canadian banks, we believe, has muted price-to-earnings multiple expansion and negatively impacted share price performance,” said Kevin Choquette, analyst at Scotiabank.

> Traders are certainly showing a preference for shorting some Canadian banks over others. CIBC has seen short interest increase 72% year-over-year, followed by Royal Bank of Canada at 28%. TD was the only bank where short interest decreased in the last year, falling 10%.

> “The increase in Canadian bank short interest, we believe, is due mainly to concerns about a housing bubble, and weak economic growth outlook,” said Mr. Choquette.

I am always worried when a trade appears too popular with the fast money crowd.

I have said it previously and I will repeat it here &#8211; &#8216;we are going to frustrate them with our Canadian-ness.&#8217;  Our housing market is not going to collapse like the American one did in 2008.  Yes, we will under perform and it will most likely be a terrible place to invest, but it isn&#8217;t going to go down 10% a quarter.  Our banks are probably expensive relative to the American ones, but they aren&#8217;t going to pull a Citibank and become suddenly insolvent overnight due to insane leverage.

We are Canadian and if there is one thing that we are &#8211; it is boring.

Ultimately this sell Canada short trade will work.  However, right now, due to the extreme sentiment, you should avoid this trade at all costs.

If I were forced to take a position for the short run, I would probably be on the other side of all of Mr. Mohan&#8217;s trades, although I am Canadian, so no way would I do it with 95% of my assets &#8211; that would be way too aggressive for me, eh?
