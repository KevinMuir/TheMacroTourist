I have been short French bonds for what seems like forever.  Although I have been skated onside by the global backup in rates, the trade has definitely not worked on a relative basis.

You will notice that rates have been moving up fairly quickly over the last month, but relative to the German rates, the French yields have actually been drifting lower:

It has been frustrating watching my short French bond position over the last few months.  On risk off days, the OATs have traded like safe havens.  On risk on days, they seem to get a bid because of PIIGS bond tightening.  I couldn&#8217;t seem to win.

However, over the last week I have noticed some more aggressively selling in the OATs market.  For example today the OATs are down 0.44 while the German Bund future is actually up 0.37.

During the last quarter, the French economy has continued to deteriorate.  The trade of short France should be working, but I believe that the Japanese QE is sending capital throughout the globe and some of it is ending up in France, delaying the market&#8217;s repricing of French assets.

I might be reading too much into this recent move &#8211; it really is barely a blip, but I think the time might be ripe for the market to start waking up to the real problems in France.

Right now I have a ton of short bond positions on, so it really wouldn&#8217;t be prudent to add to the trade on an outright basis.  However, if I trade German vs French futures, then that spread should be somewhat uncorrelated to the direction of rates.

I am buying this spread above, with a 49 basis point stop.
