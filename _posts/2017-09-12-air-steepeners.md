**NOTE:  I forgot to send out yesterday's post by email.  I apologize.  Here it is.  You will get two today!**

All credit for the first part of today's post goes to **[LongConvexity](https://twitter.com/longconvexity?lang=en)**, the mysterious Ari-Gold-type hedge fund manager, who reminded me of the enormous seasonal effect in the US 5/30 year treasury yield curve spread.  

<a href="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/AirSep1217.png"><img src="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/AirSep1217.png" alt="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/AirSep1217.png" width="300" height="400" style="margin:30px auto;display:block;"></a>

For the past eight years, the US yield curve has been flattening like a banshee, with the 5/30 spread declining from 300 basis points, all the way to the current 102 bps.

<a href="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/530Sep1217.png"><img src="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/530Sep1217.png" alt="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/530Sep1217.png" width="750" height="460" style="margin:30px auto;display:block;"></a>

Having a look at that chart, it's difficult to find a period where the curve consistently steepened.  But if we pull up the seasonal matrix, it becomes a little more obvious.

<a href="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/SeasSep1217.png"><img src="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/SeasSep1217.png" alt="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/SeasSep1217.png" width="750" height="460" style="margin:30px auto;display:block;"></a>

January has been the best month for steepening, but right behind, is September.  If you remove the terrible 2011 performance, then September is almost every bit as good as January.

I am a big, huge, Alaskan Peninsular grizzly of a bear when it comes to fixed income, but sometimes I need to find ways to express that view without just putting it all on the dark side.  Playing for a bear steepener is a great way to limit my exposure, and hopefully participate in a long end led down move.

**The trade's mechanics.**

Although bond traders are familiar with putting on yield curve spread trades, some of us that dabble in many markets, are not quite so well versed.  So I have provided the Bloomberg PDH2 hedging screen shot.

<a href="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/PDH2Sep1217.png"><img src="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/PDH2Sep1217.png" alt="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/PDH2Sep1217.png" width="750" height="460" style="margin:30px auto;display:block;"></a>

To institute the trade, you need to buy 100 five year futures for every 24 long bonds that you sell.  Obviously for non-institutional traders, you could tame that down to something like 12 fives versus 3 thirties.  That works out to approximately $600 per basis point.  So if the 5/30 spread moved up 10 bps, then that should equal $6k.  

I still hold to my belief that the bond market is set up for a big disappointment.  Massive supply is coming down the pike.  With the recent US dollar sell off, inflation is due to increase, and the hurricanes might finally resurrect the long-left-for-dead Phillips curve.  Buying 5/30 steepeners here at 102, risking down to 92, and hoping for a move back up to 130 is my new trade.  

If it doesn't work, then take some advice from that great trader, Ari Gold...

**Eurostoxx update**

I have been patiently waiting for the Eurostoxx index to break out of the past five-month downtrend.  

Yesterday it finally cleared that hurdle.

<a href="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/SX5ESep1217.png"><img src="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/SX5ESep1217.png" alt="http://themacrotourist.com/images/2017/09/SX5ESep1217.png" width="750" height="460" style="margin:30px auto;display:block;"></a>

Up, up, and away?  I am keeping my fingers crossed, and more importantly, am now looking for places to add to my long.

Thanks for reading,
