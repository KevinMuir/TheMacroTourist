As you will notice in my writings, I have become increasingly concerned about a potential bubble brewing in the financial markets. Apart from a near unanimous belief from professional investors that there is really no choice except to venture out the risk curve and buy stocks, I am also concerned about the attitude from fixed income buyers. Over the last year there has been an alarming amount of so called cov-lite bonds issued. These bonds were extremely popular in the mid 2000s and were instrumental in the blowing up of that credit bubble.

As you can see from this chart, the amount of cov-lite loans has exploded in the last year, with an all time high in issuance already recorded for 2013.

And what companies doing with much of this money? Well, they aren&#8217;t using them to hire more workers. Rather, the biggest use has been to fund stock buy backs.

This is not the stuff of solid fundamentals.

Everywhere I look I see signs of excess speculation. Here is the total margin debt at NYSE member firms versus the S&P 500:

You will notice the last time we were this high, it was 2007…

Jim Dines who writes a monthly letter summed it best when he said:

> “There is one peculiarity about mass psychology in that when you are in a bubble, you can’t see it. Bubbles are invisible when you are inside the bubble,”

I am not sure if they are completely invisible, but there definitely is always an unwillingness for the masses to heed the risks. Even when experts like Joe Baratta from Blackstone are warning (from Dow Jones):

> The U.S. is &#8220;in the middle of an epic credit bubble,&#8221; according to Blackstone Group&#8217;s global head of private equity, Joseph Baratta , and that bubble is affecting how one of the world&#8217;s largest private equity firm&#8217;s invests its billions.
> 
> The firm has slowed its investments amid such concerns, with Mr. Baratta saying he sees easy credit as adding risk for buyers of companies, even if it benefits sellers. &#8220;That largesse goes to the seller,&#8221; Mr. Baratta said, speaking at the Private Equity Analyst conference in New York.
> 
> &#8220;We are not leveraging U.S. GDP,&#8221; he said, because the good times are not going to last forever. The firm expects what Mr. Baratta called a &#8220;mean reversion,&#8221; which he said will ultimately affect exit multiples at portfolio companies.

Even though the vast majority of people are partying like it is 1999, I stumbled on this great post from Wolf Richter at the www.testosteronepit.com that outlined some of the very first cracks in the credit market:

> It could be an aberration. Or it could be the first visible crack in the insane leveraged buyout craze that has spread across the country: JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs could get hit with a combined loss of up to $156 million on the $780 million in junk debt they pledged to sell to fund the buyout of teen-fashion retailer rue21. With consequences for investors.
> 
> JPMorgan, BofA, and Goldman had tried to sell $530 million of that stuff last month but failed. So now they’re trying again, “according to people familiar with that matter,” the Wall Street Journal reported. To rid their books of the $780 million in debt, the banks are offering it at a discount of $0.80 to $0.85 on the dollar – and will have to eat the difference.
> 
> If they dump it at the low end, they’d receive $624 million, for a loss of $156 million. That the banks are even contemplating such a loss, rather than keeping that crap hidden in their basements, while waiting for sunnier days, exposes their thinking:
> 
> One, new banking regulations require that banks maintain higher capital reserves against risky paper of this type, raising the costs of holding it, and giving the banks an incentive to unload it.
> 
> Two, the banks estimate that the value of the debt will continue to go south, as rue21, teetering under its load of debt, will run into rough waters, given the dreary retail environment in the US.
> 
> And three, the banks are seeing that more hot air, despite the current reprieve, will hiss out of the junk debt market, and more generally out of the greatest debt bubble in history, and that dumping that debt now might produce a smaller loss for the banks than dumping it at a later date. This vision would be another signal for investors around the world to buckle their seatbelts.

I saved this great picture from ZeroHedge that epitomizes the current environment perfectly:

I will leave it to everyone else to pick up the easy 100s that are lying on the ground. After all, what could go wrong?
