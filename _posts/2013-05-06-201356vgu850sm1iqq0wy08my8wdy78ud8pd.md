Today&#8217;s idea is a total rip off from a great chart that David Rosenberg produced a couple of weeks ago.

The chart is the ratio of the S&P 500 and the Fed&#8217;s Total Balance Sheet.

You can see that the ratio of the S&P 500 and the Fed&#8217;s Total Balance sheet (white line) has remained remarkably stable since 2008.  During this period, the S&P 500 has basically gone straight up along with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Total Balance Sheet.

For those who don&#8217;t think there is a relationship between the Fed&#8217;s printing and the stock market, I respectfully suggest you think again.  That ratio is just too stable for this to be coincidence.

However, knowing this fact does not completely solve the question of where we go from here.

Although it has been stable during the last 5 years, that does not mean it will continue to be stable.

Maybe we are making a series of lower highs and that we are due for a big move lower in this ratio, just like in 2000 and 2008.  Or maybe the opposite will happen and we will finally escape the flat line and start to have an expanding ratio.

And even if you know what direction the ratio is headed, what about the denominator portion of this ratio?  Do you know for sure what the Fed is going to do in the coming quarters / years.?

Even though it is obvious that the Fed is having an effect on the stock market with its QE, the future course of Fed purchases is far from certain.

However, one thing is certain.  I would be very hesitant to assume that the ratio is going to collapse while the Fed is actively expanding.  Both previous highs of this ratio were created from the Fed tightening policy.  To assume that somehow this time will be different and that the ratio will collapse while the Fed is expanding is a very low probability bet.  Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, it might happen &#8211; the financial system has become very unstable.  But it is not the right bet.

So although I understand the argument that stocks are massively over valued, I also remember that in 1998 they were plenty stupid expensive before they got outrageously stupid expensive.  Shorting in 1998 or 1999 eventually was proven right, but it was one heck of a drawdown.

There is even a decent chance that given the commitment to QE that eventually stocks will receive a &#8216;flight to real assets&#8217; bid that makes the S&P 500 / Fed Total Balance Sheet ratio rise aggressively.  Although I have no real desire to play for a bubble, I am fully aware that the Fed very well might engineer another one.

Don&#8217;t ever forget what their Balance Sheet looks like:
