On Sunday the following tweet went across my twitter stream:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500f3df9e4b006cb9ec150a3/50c60ecbe4b026203261b4d3/51f6641ce4b00d3106719ece/1375101980764/Inbox%20(95%20messages)%20Jul%2029%2013.jpg" />

I respect Lawrence McDonald (@Convertbond) so I decided to do a little digging into his note.

The most obvious question was just who is this Robert Morrow?  I have never heard of him so did his opinion really deserve the attention it was getting?

When you google Robert Morrow the stock strategist does not jump to the top of the list.  I was pretty sure he wasn&#8217;t the Robert Morrow &#8220;maker of fine bows for string instruments&#8221;.  I also quickly deduced that he wasn&#8217;t the Robert Morrow Irish receiver of the Victoria Cross for actions during the First World War nor the Robert Morrow Professor of History at Morgan State University (wherever that is) even though Google put him to the top of my list.

With a little more digging I found the article buried in the week-end WSJ:

> For more than 25 years, Robert Morrow has used &#8220;vibration analysis&#8221; to predict major moves in the stock market, many times with near-preternatural accuracy.

> The octogenarian former electrical engineer with 38 patents has done it well enough to earn both top rankings in Timer Digest market-timing surveys and several _Barron&#8217;s_ mentions, starting in 1990, when Morrow predicted the Dow would bottom out in the fourth quarter of that year at 2366. The market sank to 2365. In the world of market timing, that&#8217;s called hitting the bull&#8217;s eye. Oh, he also predicted the 2007 market crash.

> Now Morrow, who studied vibrations in mechanical structures for patterns that would portend structural failure, is detecting a decidedly sour vibe from the Standard & Poor&#8217;s 500 stock index, using daily closing prices. &#8220;A bear market is imminent, within days,&#8221; says Morrow, who sells his research to a small cadre of institutional clients through Robert Morrow Institutional Advisory, in Bradenton, Fla. A 20% drop, a common definition of a bear market, would cut the S&P by 338 points, leaving it well below its recent 1690, at 1352.

Now I am not one to highlight what some eighty year old retired electrical engineer&#8217;s thinks about the market (I have my own 70 year old semi-retired former mechanical engineer father to get me in trouble with his market views).  However as I continued to research this Robert Morrow I found out that he sells his service for $10,000 a year to investors.  And he did indeed call the 2007/8 credit crash correctly.

Let&#8217;s put a timestamp on this entry and look back 6 months from now to see if the 80 year old still has the magic touch or if that $10,000 bucks a year is wasted money for the investors who are bankrolling Morrow&#8217;s retirement.

I am worried that I am cherry picking market calls that affirm my thesis, but at the same time, I kind of like being a lonely bear with only some strange quiet 80 year strategist who correctly predicted the 2007/8 crash in my camp.
