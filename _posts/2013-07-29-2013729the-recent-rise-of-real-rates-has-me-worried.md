When the 2007/8 credit crisis hit, stocks declined to valuations that perplexed many stock analysts.  I distinctly remember reading all sorts of research that would discuss the massive discount to NAV (net asset value).  These analysts were running their models and spitting out numbers that seemed to indicate that stocks were trading at levels that made no sense.

However, as I would dig through their analysis I realized there was a common error running through almost all of their models.  All of these analysts were using the risk free interest rate to discount the future cash flows.

At the time investors were clamouring for safety, so during the credit crisis of 2007/8 the risk free rate went into free fall.

These analysts were all using this rate in their models, so the stocks would appear to be astoundingly cheap.

However what they were missing was that the rate for bonds of anything other than governments was **exploding higher.**

Here is the chart of the BBB bond versus the risk free rate:

So although the risk free rate was moving lower, the rate for company debt was more than offsetting this with a massive move upward.

The analysts were all thumping the table to buy equity in all of these companies that appeared so cheap, but meanwhile, the much better risk reward was found in the bonds.  There were a few issues that instead of buying the equity, I bought bonds at 30 cents on the dollar that were money good within the year.

You are probably asking yourself what does this have to do with today?

I am concerned that the extraordinary move down to below 2% in the US treasury 10 year yield during 2012 has caused investors to misjudge the proper the risk free rate when evaluating pricing for all other assets.   This risk free rate is the key underpinning to the pricing of so many assets, I worry that if that move to sub 2% was artificial or unsustainable, then most other asset markets might have rallied to unjustifiable levels.

Unlike 2007/8 when risk free rates plummeted but credit spreads blew out, during 2012 investors chased risk free assets to all time lows, then moved to corporate bonds and then other risky assets, in essence bidding up all asset classes across the board.

However recently we have experienced a dramatic rise in this risk free rate.  I am not yet sure if this move up in the bond market is a blip or the start of something more ominous.  But I am concerned that as real rates (nominal rates minus inflation) stay elevated, then all asset prices might be too high.

Here is the chart of the 10 year yield minus the CPI Year over year rate:

You will notice that real rates hit a low of minus 2% in 2011, but have since been chugging higher.

During a regular economic cycle you would expect real rates to head higher as real economic activity accelerates and there is an increased demand for capital.

However, this latest move higher in real rates has coincided with a decrease in economic activity.

Which brings me to my real worry.  Are real rates headed higher because of increased economic activity, or could real rates be headed higher due to a lack of capital?  Could the Central Banks&#8217; ability to keep real rates negative be weaning?  Is there maybe a need to forever increase the amount of monetary stimulus to keep rates so firmly negative and could we have maybe hit a politically impossible threshold (for the time being)?

I am not sure.  I am very concerned about the potential that this back up in rates is not the result of increased real economic activity but a sign that something is amiss.

Right now I am going to reserve judgement but this is at the top of my radar.
