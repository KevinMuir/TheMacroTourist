Yesterday the Gold Miner Stock Index (GDX) broke out to a new two month high.<figure id="attachment_13881" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

What was interesting was that the GDX lead the actual metal.  Gold itself did not make a new high yesterday.<figure id="attachment_13891" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-13891" alt="GOLDFeb1014.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/GOLDFeb1014.png" width="600" height="340" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GOLDFeb1014-300x170.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GOLDFeb1014.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/GOLDFeb1014.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Gold Spot Price &#8211; no break out yesterday</figcaption></figure> 

I am not sure if this is a case where the gold stocks are rising faster than the metal just because they are equities and participating in the general rise in the price of stocks.  Or if this is a case where the gold stocks have sniffed out some better news to come.

Either case, I am not complaining.  I am long both the actual metal and the GDX (through being short a triple inverse bear ETF on that index).

Although I am fortunate enough to have caught this move, I am taking no victory laps.  I have been taking stabs at the long side of the gold market for the last year, and it has done nothing but cost me money.  A stopped clock might show the right time twice a day, but it is pretty useless as a time piece.

I take solace in that I am no gold bug and I haven&#8217;t been buying it all the way down.  My position has come about as over the last year I have become progressively more bullish as prices have retreated.  After taking different positions throughout the year and giving up as prices continually fell in my face, towards the end of the year I got very enthusiastic about the price of gold and the gold miners as I viewed the abject negativity that pervaded throughout the financial community as completely over done and illogical.  I justified my big long position by noting that we had maybe $200 of downside to $1,000 where so much production would become uneconomic that supply would vanish overnight, against the chance that maybe the Central Banks finally ignite the inflationary bonfire that has up to now been merely smouldering.  If that happened, the upside for gold could be quite explosive, with a doubling happening quite easily.  So for me, it was $200 downside versus maybe $2,000 upside.  Easy bet.  I bit the bullet and bought a big slug of precious metals and the gold mining stocks.

Now it is working, but for how long?

There can be no doubt that gold is down a long way.  One measure I like to look at is the ratio of the price of gold to the level of the S&P 500 index.  Since peaking at over 1.60 during the European credit crisis, the ratio has been on a steady decline to the point where it has been more than halved.  Gold&#8217;s rise over the last couple of months is a mere tiny blip on the big picture chart:<figure id="attachment_13901" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-13901" alt="GLDSPXFeb1014.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/GLDSPXFeb1014.png" width="600" height="342" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GLDSPXFeb1014-300x171.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GLDSPXFeb1014.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/GLDSPXFeb1014.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ratio of the price of gold to the level of the S&P 500</figcaption></figure> 

You could be the biggest gold bear out there and even you would have to begrudgingly admit that given gold&#8217;s massive underperformance over the last couple of years, a period of gold price rising relative to stocks would not be unreasonable to expect.  Even just a slight correction back to the 1.00 level on this ratio would mean a rise of $500 in the price of gold (or a corresponding drop in the S&P).

The big picture is that gold is extremely washed out and that regardless of whether this is a correction in a bear market, or a resumption of the long term massive bull market, gold can head higher for some time yet.

You might be asking yourself why did gold get pummelled like a red headed step child?  The damage was quite extensive and given the recent price appreciation, it easy to forget the true viciousness of the recent gold bear market.

First and foremost, gold got destroyed because it was hedge fund hotel.  The hedgies had all loaded up on gold, convincing each other about the validity of their position until towards the end they were merely talking in an echo chamber and increasingly buying more and more in an unsustainable orgy.  The &#8220;China miracle&#8221; and the &#8220;QE will result in inflation&#8221; were prevalent themes and gold was the perfect trade.  Hedge funds like to think that they are outside the box thinkers, but they are all outside the same box and moving in the same direction to the next box they can stand outside of.

Secondly, gold entered a bear market because much to everyone&#8217;s surprise, real rates actually rose.  Most people mistakenly think gold moves with inflation.  Although gold is influenced by inflation, it is only one half of the puzzle.  During the period from 2000 to 2010 when gold moved from $250 to $1900, inflation ran between -2% and 5%, but probably averaged 2.5%.  Hardly the sort of roaring inflation that would result in gold going up by a factor of 800%.  What is much more important than inflation is the real rate of interest.  Gold is negatively correlated to the real rate of interest.  If inflation is running 3% but interest rates are 1%, then the real rate of interest is negative 2% and that is extremely positive for the price of gold.  If inflation is still 3%, but interest rates are 6%, then the real rate of interest is positive 3% and gold suffers.

Have a look at this chart of gold during the 1980s.  The white line is the inverse of the US 10 Year Treasury Yield minus CPI.  As it goes higher, that means a more negative real rate of interest.<figure id="attachment_13971" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-13971" alt="GOLDRR80sFeb1114.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/GOLDRR80sFeb1114.png" width="600" height="382" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GOLDRR80sFeb1114-300x191.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GOLDRR80sFeb1114.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/GOLDRR80sFeb1114.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Inverse of Real 10 year rate (white line) vs Gold (yellow line)</figcaption></figure> 

The first bull market from 1973 to 1975 looks small because of the subsequent move to $800, but on a percentage basis it was still a double.  You will notice that it stopped rising when real interest rates rose (fell on this chart).  But then in 1978 real rates once again went negative and ushered in the massive bull move to $800.  It ended when Volcker cranked rates and once again put the real rate of interest positive.

Enough with the history lesson, let&#8217;s look at the recent gold bear move and see if real rates can once again explain the gold price action.<figure id="attachment_13911" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-13911" alt="GOLDSvsRRFeb1014.PNG" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/GOLDSvsRRFeb1014.png" width="600" height="342" srcset="http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GOLDSvsRRFeb1014-300x171.png 300w, http://themacrotourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GOLDSvsRRFeb1014.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2014/02/GOLDSvsRRFeb1014.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Inverse of 10 Year real rate (green line) vs Gold price (yellow line)</figcaption></figure> 

And here once again, the real interest rate explains a fair bit of the move of the gold market.

Which then leaves the gold bull with the problem of trying to decide what real interest rates are going to do in the coming quarters/years.

Don&#8217;t forget that real rates are nominal rates minus the rate of inflation.   If you believe that the economy can handle positive real rates, and that the inflation will stay in check, then by no means should you own gold.

If you are like me and believe that the level of total indebtedness only continues to climb and that there is no way that Western societies can handle consistent positive real rates for an extended period of time, and thus rates are going to consistently be kept low, then you should own gold.  Owning gold is a hedge against the financial repression of negative real rates.

In the mean time, the GDX is breaking out and I am sitting tight with both my miners and precious metals.  If I wasn&#8217;t so gun shy I would actually be adding to the position, but for now, all I can say is &#8211; sshhhhh&#8230;. let&#8217;s stop talking about it in case we goocher the trade.

**Positions**

**Short European stocks via ESTX50 index vs Long S&P 500.** I continue to believe that the ECB is too tight relative to the Fed and the BoJ, and that this will translate into relative weakness of European equities.   **On Friday I turned this into a spread trade by buying S&P 500 futures on the other side.  There is no longer any delta associated with the position and it is purely a relative performance trade.  **Conviction 5

**Short Euro.  **Not much to say, I didn&#8217;t enter this trade very well, but I still think the Euro works it way lower in coming months. Conviction 4

****Short Yen.****  Establish short Yen last week.  Now I will sit tight and wait.  Conviction 4

**Short JGB futures.  **I can&#8217;t call myself a macro trader without this widow maker on the sheets. Small position for now, but will add aggressively at the first sign it is working. Conviction level: 2. No stop.

**Long Yen volatility. ** I believe we are entering a period of increased volatility for the FX pair.  **Conviction: 3**

**Long 30 year US treasury volatility.** Swapping half of this position into Yen volatility.  Conviction 2

**Long various deferred crude oil futures contracts.** I own a variety of different expiries in years from December 2014 all the way to December 2020. Conviction level: 5. No hard stop.

**Long precious metals smorgasbord. Long gold, silver and platinum futures.** I also believe that the closed end ETFs (CEF.A CN Equity or PHYS US Equity) which are now trading at discounts versus years of trading at a premium are a good way to play this idea. Conviction level: 5. Using the year end lows as a stop for half the position.

**Short DUST (triple inverse GDX ETF).** I hate being long double and triple ETFs as the volatility chews you up, so when possible I like to be on the other side of that trade and short the ETFs. Just being outright long GDX (gold stock miners) is the equivalent delta position. Conviction level: 3. No hard stop as I am hoping that GDX will at the very least just base in here and DUST will slowly decay.

**Long grains. Long deferred corn, wheat and soybean futures.** Although this trade has not worked at all, I really like it long term. Conviction level:6. No stop period.

**Long Ithaca Energy IAE CN Equity.** See previous posts. Conviction level: 5

**Long Input Capital INP CN Equity.** I have not yet written this up, but I really like this story. More to come in coming days. Conviction level: 5
