In the mid 2000s I remember having a discussion with a buddy of mine who is a big time equity manager. We were discussing the possibilities of a Japanese style deflation in the US. His comments stuck with me and I have thought about them often over the years:

&#8220;We will never have a Japanese style deflation in the US, the authorities and the public would never stand for it.&#8221;

His comment proved partly correct, the authorities and the public certainly have done everything in their power to avoid a Japanese style deflation, but their success has been relatively muted. Like or not, the larger credit super cycle has overwhelmed the authorities ability to influence the economic landscape.

We are now 5 years into the recovery since the great credit crash and the economic situation resembles Japan way more than anyone would have guessed a decade ago. It is increasingly looking like Japan was not some aberration that the US and other Western countries could dismiss as the result of poor economic policies, but rather Japan was simply a decade ahead the rest of the world in their battle with deflation.

Although in the years after the credit crisis of 2008 many market participants were optimistic that we could avoid the Japanese fate, over the last year there has been a tidal shift in opinion about the ability of the Western countries to ever create inflation again. **We have gone from a complete surety that Japan could never happen in the Western economies, to a new found submission that we are powerless to stop it.** 

After the credit crisis crash and the introduction of the various QE policies, there was a lot of worry about the consequences of the bold actions. There was a lot of talk about how it would create inflation and to some degree this worry made it difficult for the economy to gain traction. At every step the market worried that the Fed would overshoot and be forced to cut back quickly. Capital went into hard assets instead of productive ones in an attempt to protect its purchasing power from what was thought to be, the incipient inflation. Except the inflation never came. 

The trade of betting on increased inflation due to the aggressive Central Bank policies has proved a disaster and the investors who have been advocating it have been thoroughly crucified. 

This transformation of market opinion towards full acceptance that we are indeed Japan has recently been made complete with the ground swell of opinion that QE does not matter and that worrying about inflation is a 20th century folly.

I note the recent speech by Larry Summers that outlined why we are going to have to live with zero interest rates for a long, long time. Or how Paul Krugman quickly jumped on the bandwagon and echoed the sentiment that inflation was nowhere to be found on the horizon. This great [post](http://azizonomics.com/2013/10/26/why-i-was-wrong-about-inflation/) from the blog Aziznomics exemplifies the shift that many market participants have had regarding the inevitability about inflation.

Where it was once very fashionable to worry about inflation, it has now become completely accepted that the Fed is powerless to create inflation.

This has resulted in very large shifts of the portfolio composition of investors. It can probably be best summed up with this one chart &#8211; the ratio of the price of gold to the price of the S&P 500:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://themacrotourist.com/blogs/2013/11/GLDSPXNov2213.gif" alt="GLDSPXNov2213" title="GLDSPXNov2213.gif" border="0" width="600" height="429" />

The height of the &#8220;incipient inflation&#8221; worry was probably hit in the summer of 2011. Since then investors have been steadily abandoning this trade, with this ratio getting more than halved. They have sold their &#8220;hard inflation&#8221; assets and moved into more productive assets. 

The acceptance of this new era of &#8220;the Fed is powerless to create inflation&#8221; has two important implications. 

The first and easiest one is that where as assets that were deemed to protect you against inflation were bid up during the post 2008 crash period, they are now dirt cheap. In 2010 or 2011 inflation needed to come in higher than the &#8220;worry&#8221; rate for you to make money. They were priced for what many believed to be a coming new age of inflation. They are now priced for the new era of the &#8220;Fed is powerless&#8221; to create inflation, so the hurdle to make money is that much lower. I would much rather buy an asset that is priced for disappointment than one filled with inflated expectations.

The second and more subtle point about this new found thinking of the &#8220;Fed is powerless to create inflation&#8221; is that it very well might be the last needed piece of the puzzle to actually create inflation. If the investing public is worried about inflation due to the large Central Bank balance sheet, then the moment that inflation ticks up, the market will anticipate a withdrawal of stimulus. The financial conditions will tighten on their own, and the recovery will stall. This is why some really bright guys like Paul MacCauley formerly from PIMCO speak about the Fed being &#8220;responsibly irresponsible.&#8221; Maybe if the public believes that the Fed is powerless to create inflation, it will usher in the necessary conditions for the expansion to continue. And even if you don&#8217;t buy that theory, then the acceptance that the Fed cannot create inflation will allow the Fed to expand to an even greater degree, thus increasing the chance of an eventual overshoot.

One thing I know is that markets don&#8217;t often predict problems in advance. If they did, then the crashes like 1987 or 2008 would not occur. The fact that now, with the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet as big as it has ever been, with the Bank of Japan also aggressively expanding their balance sheet to record highs and even the ECB talking about negative rates, the market has decided _that inflation is not coming_ gives me absolutely no confidence. 

Timing this of course will be difficult. As one of my buddies likes to say about his trading &#8211; &#8220;I am never wrong, my timing just sucks sometimes.&#8221; 

I don&#8217;t know if inflation is coming tomorrow, next week, next year, or 5 years from now. However, as long as the worlds&#8217; Central Banks continue to expand their balance sheets in this irresponsible fashion, then I believe that inflation will come. The fact that it has become fashionable to believe otherwise is merely a reflection of the lack of success so far. 

Remember &#8211; at one point everyone believed that the Western economies would never suffer a Japanese style deflation. The fact that everyone now believes that we are powerless to change that should bring you no solace.

I believe that the market is in the process of making a big mistake in their pricing of the likelihood of the worlds&#8217; Central Banks losing control. In the coming posts I will show you some of the ways that I hope to take advantage of this.
