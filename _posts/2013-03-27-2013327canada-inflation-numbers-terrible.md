This morning the Bank of Canada released the latest Canadian inflation numbers.  To say they were bad is like saying that Linday Lohan only has a little problem with alcohol and drugs.

The CPI Year over Year (YoY) was expected at 0.8%.  It came in at 1.2%.  The Core CPI YoY (which is what the economists love to use when setting monetary policy) was expected at 0.3%  but came in at 0.8%.

Two days ago I covered my short BAX futures.  Given the increasing inflationary pressures I am going to put that trade right back on.

This number is consistent with my theme that North America is doing significantly better than Europe and Asia.  Given that belief, I am also going to move my short CAD position into short AUD.  I am actually short both AUD and CAD, but now I will be short only AUD.  Recently AUD has performed significantly better than CAD as the Reserve Bank of Australia had toned down the signalling of future easing.  In my mind this CPI release will force the Bank of Canada to increase their tightening rhetoric and at the margin, will send the AUDCAD cross rate lower.

I am also going to focus any of my short North America fixed income trades on Canadian government bonds.  This morning due to the ongoing worries in Europe, we are getting a large rally in bond markets throughout the world.  This has dropped yields to new 4 month lows.  I am using this strength in the Canadian bond market to initiate an outright short position.

It is a little scary shorting bonds into this morning&#8217;s carnage (European stock markets are down over 1.5% across the board), but I am good and short European stock indexes.  This shorting of Canadian bond futures will be somewhat of a hedge.

I think the Bank of Canada has probably misjudged how quickly inflation is perking up,  They will be forced to play catch up.  Once markets settle down, participants will begin to realize that Canada will most likely be forced raise rates before the US.

### Update

The CPI numbers actually rose at the fastest monthly pace in more than 20 years!

A funny quote on the Bloomberg from Camilla Sutton who is the chief currency strategist at ScotiaBank in Toronto:

&#8220;The firming is somewhat positive but it doesn&#8217;t throw us into a new area in terms of Central Bank policy.&#8221;

Ok, we have the lowest Overnight Rate in the history of the Bank of Canada with now the largest increase in CPI in the last 20 years, yet this somehow means there will be no change in policy?

I am willing to take the other side of Camilla&#8217;s trade.  Sold to you!
